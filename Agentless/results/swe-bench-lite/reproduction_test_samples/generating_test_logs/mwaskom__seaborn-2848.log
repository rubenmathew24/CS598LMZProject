--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
pairplot fails with hue_order not containing all hue values in seaborn 0.11.1
In seaborn < 0.11, one could plot only a subset of the values in the hue column, by passing a hue_order list containing only the desired values. Points with hue values not in the list were simply not plotted.
```python
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")`
# The hue column contains three different species; here we want to plot two
sns.pairplot(iris, hue="species", hue_order=["setosa", "versicolor"])
```

This no longer works in 0.11.1. Passing a hue_order list that does not contain some of the values in the hue column raises a long, ugly error traceback. The first exception arises in seaborn/_core.py:
```
TypeError: ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''
```
seaborn version: 0.11.1
matplotlib version: 3.3.2
matplotlib backends: MacOSX, Agg or jupyter notebook inline.

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."

        return

    return

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.

3. Print statements to indicate the outcome based on the issue reproduction:

   - "Issue resolved" if no error occurs (implying the issue might have been fixed).
   - "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised.

This test can be used to verify if the issue with `hue_order` in Seaborn's pairplot function is still present or has been resolved.

This test script performs the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules (`seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`).
2. Loads the iris dataset.
3. Attempts to create a pairplot with a `hue_order` list that only contains a subset of the hue values.
4. Uses a try-except block to catch and identify the specific error, which is indicative of the issue described.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the pairplot is created without raising an exception.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific error related to the issue is raised.
7. Prints "Other issues" if a different error is raised.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** The test imports `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.
2. **Reproduce the issue:** The test loads the `iris` dataset and tries to create a pairplot with a subset of `hue` values as described in the issue.
3. **Print statements for different cases:**
   - If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the specific `TypeError` associated with the issue is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been fixed in future versions.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**:
   - `seaborn` for creating the pairplot.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` to handle plot closing.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Load the iris dataset.
   - Attempt to create a pairplot with the hue_order parameter that doesn't cover all unique values in the "species" column.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - Catch `TypeError` and check if the specific error message ("ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types") is present to confirm the issue is reproduced.
   - Handle any other exceptions as "Other issues".
   - Print "Issue resolved" if no exceptions are raised, indicating the issue has been fixed.

This test script:
1. Imports necessary libraries (`seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`).
2. Loads the iris dataset.
3. Attempts to create a pairplot with `hue_order` that doesn't include all values in the hue column.
4. Catches the specific `TypeError` to verify if the issue is reproduced.
5. Distinguishes between the described issue and other potential issues by printing relevant messages. 

You can run this script to check if the issue is reproduced or resolved. If the issue described in the text occurs, it will print "Issue reproduced". If no error occurs, it will print "Issue resolved". For any other issues, it will print "Other issues".

4. Attempts to create a `pairplot` with a `hue_order` that includes only a subset of the hue values.
5. Catches a `TypeError` if it occurs and checks if the error message matches the one described in the issue.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the described error message is caught.
7. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exceptions are raised.
8. Prints "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised or if the error message is different.

        iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

        # The hue column contains three different species; here we want to plot two
        sns.pairplot(iris, hue="species", hue_order=["setosa", "versicolor"])
        plt.close()

        print("Issue resolved")
    except TypeError as e:
        if "ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types" in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced")

```

Here's a breakdown of the script:
1. **Imports**: Necessary imports from `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.
2. **Dataset Loading**: Loads the iris dataset.
3. **Pairplot Call**: Attempts to create a pairplot with a `hue_order` that doesn't include all unique values in the hue column.
4. **Exception Handling**:
   - If a `TypeError` containing `ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other `TypeError` or exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
   - If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

Running this script with seaborn version 0.11.1 should reproduce the issue if it still exists, and can verify if the issue has been fixed if tested with future versions.
