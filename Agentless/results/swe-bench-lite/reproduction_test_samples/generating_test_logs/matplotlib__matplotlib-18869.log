--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Add easily comparable version info to toplevel
<!--
Welcome! Thanks for thinking of a way to improve Matplotlib.


Before creating a new feature request please search the issues for relevant feature requests.
-->

### Problem

Currently matplotlib only exposes `__version__`.  For quick version checks, exposing either a `version_info` tuple (which can be compared with other tuples) or a `LooseVersion` instance (which can be properly compared with other strings) would be a small usability improvement.

(In practice I guess boring string comparisons will work just fine until we hit mpl 3.10 or 4.10 which is unlikely to happen soon, but that feels quite dirty :))
<!--
Provide a clear and concise description of the problem this feature will solve. 

For example:
* I'm always frustrated when [...] because [...]
* I would like it if [...] happened when I [...] because [...]
* Here is a sample image of what I am asking for [...]
-->

### Proposed Solution

I guess I slightly prefer `LooseVersion`, but exposing just a `version_info` tuple is much more common in other packages (and perhaps simpler to understand).  The hardest(?) part is probably just bikeshedding this point :-)
<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of a way to accomplish what you want. For example:

* Add an option so that when [...]  [...] will happen
 -->

### Additional context and prior art

`version_info` is a pretty common thing (citation needed).
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. You can also include links to examples of other programs that have something similar to your request. For example:

Here\'s the logic behind how it works:\n1. It first checks that the `matplotlib` module has the `__version__` attribute.\n2. Then, it tries to access a `version_info` attribute that should contain version information in a comparable format.\n3. If `version_info` is not present, it attempts to construct a `LooseVersion` object using the `__version__` string.\n4.

Based on the issue described, we need to test for the presence of a `version_info` tuple or `LooseVersion` instance in Matplotlib\'s top-level namespace. We will also verify that the comparison operations work as expected. The provided test will check whether `version_info` or `LooseVersion` is exposed and then compare the versions accordingly.\n\nHere is the complete test code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\n\ndef test_version_info():\n    try:\n        # Check if \'version_info\' is present in the matplotlib module\n        if hasattr(matplotlib, \'version_info\'):\n            version_info = matplotlib.version_info\n            assert isinstance(version_info, tuple), "version_info is not a tuple"\n            # example comparison to check if version_info works correctly\n            if version_info >= (3, 0, 0):\n                print("Issue resolved")\n            else:\n                print("Issue reproduced")\n            return\n        # Check if \'LooseVersion\' instance is present in the matplotlib module\n        elif hasattr(matplotlib, \'__looseversion__\'):\n            from distutils.version import LooseVersion\n            version_info = LooseVersion(matplotlib.__looseversion__)\n            assert isinstance(version_info, LooseVersion), "__looseversion__ is not a LooseVersion instance"\n            # example comparison to check if LooseVersion works correctly\n            if version_info >= LooseVersion(\'3.0.0\'):\n                print("Issue resolved")\n            else:\n                print("Issue reproduced")\n            return\n        else:\n            print("Issue reproduced")\n    except Exception:\n        print("Other issues")\n        return\n\ntest_version_info()\n```\n\nThis test performs the following steps:\n1.

If `version_info` is present, it verifies that it\'s a tuple and performs a comparison to ensure it works correctly.\n3. If `version_info` is not present, it checks for the presence of `LooseVersion`.\n4. If `LooseVersion` is found, it ensures the version can be compared correctly.\n5. If neither is found or if other issues arise, it prints appropriate messages.\n\nYou can run this test in your environment to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved with the current state of your repository.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)), Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=23, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='```python\nimport matplotlib\n\ndef test_version_info():\n    # Reproducing the issue described in the issue text\n    try:\n        version = matplotlib.__version__\n        try:\n            major, minor, patch = map(int, version.split(\'.\'))\n            print("Issue resolved")\n        except ValueError:\n            print("Issue reproduced")\n            return\n    except AttributeError:\n        print("Other issues")\n        return\n    \n    return\n\ntest_version_info()\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports the `matplotlib` library.\n2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The test attempts to split the `__version__` attribute of the `matplotlib` library and convert it into a tuple of integers.

test_version_info_exposure()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
   - `matplotlib` is the main module we are checking.
   - `LooseVersion` from `distutils.version` is used to check if LooseVersion is properly exposed.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - Check if `version_info` is present and is a tuple.
   - Alternatively, check if `LooseVersion` is being correctly used.

3. **Print outcomes**:
   - `Issue resolved`: If `version_info` is a tuple or `LooseVersion` is correctly used.
   - `Issue reproduced`: If neither `version_info` nor `LooseVersion` is available.
   - `Other issues`: If any other type of issue is encountered.

Run this script to determine if the issue with exposing version information in an easily comparable format is resolved or not.

This script tests whether the `version_info` tuple or `LooseVersion` instance is exposed at the top level of the `matplotlib` package. It prints "Issue reproduced" if these attributes are not found or not of the expected type, "Issue resolved" if they are correctly exposed, and "Other issues" if any other exceptions are encountered.

test_version_info()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - We import the `matplotlib` module to check for the presence of `version_info`.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - The `test_version_info` function verifies if `version_info` is an attribute of the `matplotlib` module.
   - If `version_info` is not found, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If `version_info` is found, it checks if it is a tuple and if its elements are integers. This is based on the common convention of how a `version_info` attribute is typically structured.

3. **Output Statements**:
   - "Issue reproduced" is printed if `version_info` is not found or if an `AttributeError` is raised.
   - "Issue resolved" is printed if `version_info` is found and is a tuple of integers.
   - "Other issues" is printed if any other type of error occurs, such as the elements of `version_info` not being integers.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue (if `version_info` is not present or incorrectly formatted) and to verify the issue has been fixed (if `version_info` is correctly present and formatted).

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** We import the `matplotlib` module.
2. **Reproducing the issue:** We check if `matplotlib` has either `version_info` or `LooseVersion` attributes. The absence of both indicates the issue.
3. **Outcome:**
    - If neither `version_info` nor `LooseVersion` are found, print "Issue reproduced".
    - If either `version_info` or `LooseVersion` is found, print "Issue resolved".
    - Catch any exceptions that may arise and print "Other issues" with the exception message.

This test can be used to verify if `version_info` or `LooseVersion` is available, and it will help in verifying if the issue has been resolved once the necessary changes are made.

1. **Necessary Imports**: Import the `matplotlib` library and `LooseVersion` from `distutils.version`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: We first check if `matplotlib` has a `version_info` attribute. If it does, we verify that it is a tuple. If not, we check for the presence of `LooseVersion` and validate that it's an instance of `LooseVersion`.
3. **Print Statements Based on Outcome**:
   - `print("Issue resolved")`: If either `version_info` is a tuple or `LooseVersion` is correctly implemented.
   - `print("Issue reproduced")`: If neither `version_info` nor `LooseVersion` is found.
   - `print("Other issues:", str(e))`: If any other exception occurs during the execution.

This test will help to identify whether the issue has been resolved or if it persists.

This script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary `matplotlib` module.
2. Tries to access the `__version__` attribute from `matplotlib`.
3. Checks if either `version_info` or `LooseVersion` is implemented.
4. If neither is implemented, the issue is reproduced.
5. If `version_info` is implemented, it verifies that it matches the split `__version__`.
6. If `LooseVersion` is implemented, it verifies that it matches the `__version__`.
7. Prints "Issue resolved" if the implementation is correct.
8. Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" if other errors occur.

You can use this test to both reproduce the issue before implementing the proposed solution and to verify the issue has been fixed after the implementation.

### Test Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import the `matplotlib` library.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - First, we check if the `__version__` attribute exists in the `matplotlib` module.
   - Then, we attempt to access the `version_info` attribute.
   - If `version_info` is not present, it will raise an `AttributeError` and print "Issue reproduced".
   - If `version_info` is present, it will print "Issue resolved".
3. **Exception Handling**: Any other exceptions will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test will help check if the `version_info` attribute is implemented in the `matplotlib` module, which addresses the issue described.

In this test script:
1. We check for the presence of `__version__` to determine the current version of Matplotlib.
2. We check if `version_info` or `LooseVersion` is exposed in the top level of the Matplotlib module.
3. We print "Issue resolved" if `version_info` is a tuple or `LooseVersion` is properly instantiated.
4. We print "Issue reproduced" if neither `version_info` nor `LooseVersion` is found.
5. We print "Other issues" if there are any other problems or the types do not match the expected types.

This test is intended to be run after implementing the proposed solution in the Matplotlib repository.

This test script aims to validate the presence of the `version_info` or `LooseVersion` attributes in the `matplotlib` module, as described in the issue. Here's the logic behind how it works:
1. It first checks that the `matplotlib` module has the `__version__` attribute.
2. Then, it tries to access a `version_info` attribute that should contain version information in a comparable format.
3. If `version_info` is not present, it attempts to construct a `LooseVersion` object using the `__version__` string.
4. If neither of these attributes is present, the issue is considered reproduced.
5. If any other unexpected errors occur, it will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.
2025-05-03 14:14:47,495 - INFO - raw output:
Certainly! Based on the issue described, we need to test for the presence of a `version_info` tuple or `LooseVersion` instance in Matplotlib's top-level namespace. We will also verify that the comparison operations work as expected. The provided test will check whether `version_info` or `LooseVersion` is exposed and then compare the versions accordingly.

Here is the complete test code:

            version_info = LooseVersion(matplotlib.__looseversion__)
            assert isinstance(version_info, LooseVersion), "__looseversion__ is not a LooseVersion instance"
            # example comparison to check if LooseVersion works correctly
            if version_info >= LooseVersion('3.0.0'):

            print("Issue reproduced")
    except Exception:

        return

test_version_info()
```

This test performs the following steps:
1. It checks if `version_info` (as a tuple) is present in the `matplotlib` module.
2. If `version_info` is present, it verifies that it's a tuple and performs a comparison to ensure it works correctly.
3. If `version_info` is not present, it checks for the presence of `LooseVersion`.
4. If `LooseVersion` is found, it ensures the version can be compared correctly.
5. If neither is found or if other issues arise, it prints appropriate messages.

You can run this test in your environment to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved with the current state of your repository.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports the `matplotlib` library.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The test attempts to split the `__version__` attribute of the `matplotlib` library and convert it into a tuple of integers. If this straightforward conversion fails (i.e., `ValueError`), it indicates that the version string isn't suitable for easy comparisons, thus reproducing the issue.
3. **Outcome Messages**: Depending on the results of the operations, the test prints appropriate messages.
   - If the version string can be successfully split and converted to a tuple of integers, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If a `ValueError` occurs during conversion, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If an `AttributeError` occurs (e.g., if `__version__` isn't present), it prints "Other issues".

This test will help verify if the version information needs improvement as described in the issue text.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - `matplotlib`: The library in question.
   - `LooseVersion` from `distutils.version`: To handle version comparison.

2. **Function to Test the Version Info**:
   - `test_version_info()` function checks whether `version_info` or `LooseVersion` is available.
   - It verifies that `version_info` is a tuple of integers or that `LooseVersion` is properly instantiated.
   - If neither is found, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - Any assertion failure or unexpected exception prints "Other issues".

3. **Outcome Reporting**:
   - "Issue resolved" if the expected attributes are present and valid.
   - "Issue reproduced" if the expected attributes are absent.
   - "Other issues" for other unexpected problems.

This test ensures that both the presence and correctness of the new versioning attributes can be checked.

```

This script attempts to access `version_info` or `LooseVersion` and verifies if they exist and are of the correct type. The script will print "Issue resolved" if either of the proposed solutions is present and correctly implemented. If neither is present, it will print "Issue reproduced". If there are other issues, it will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

Run this test after implementing the proposed solution to verify that the issue has been resolved. If the issue persists, the test will reproduce it accordingly.

Certainly! Below is a complete test script that can be used to reproduce the issue described in the provided issue text:

```python
import matplotlib

def test_version_comparison() -> None:
    try:
        # Extract the version as a string
        version_str = matplotlib.__version__
        print(f"Current version string: {version_str}")

        # Split the version string to create a tuple for comparison
        version_info = tuple(map(int, version_str.split('.')))

        # Check if the version info is correctly extracted
        assert isinstance(version_info, tuple), "version_info is not a tuple"
        assert all(isinstance(v, int) for v in version_info), "version_info does not contain integers"

        # Perform a comparison to check if the version is greater than some version, e.g., (3, 3, 0)
        compare_version = (3, 3, 0)
        if version_info > compare_version:

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(e)

test_version_comparison()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports the `matplotlib` package.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The current version of matplotlib is fetched using `matplotlib.__version__`.
   - The version string is split and converted into a tuple of integers, which is proposed as a part of the solution.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - It checks if the `version_info` is a tuple and contains integers.
   - It performs a version comparison with an example version `(3, 3, 0)` to determine if the current version is greater.
   - Depending on the comparison, it prints "Issue resolved" if the version is greater; otherwise, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. **Error handling**: If any exceptions occur, it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.

This test should help verify whether the issue described in the issue text has been resolved by checking the version comparison functionality.

In the provided test, the following steps are taken:

1. Imports the necessary `matplotlib` library.
2. Defines the function `test_matplotlib_version_comparison` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Attempts to get the current version with `matplotlib.__version__`.
4. Checks if the current version is greater than "3.1.0" using string comparison to identify the issue.
5. Depending on how the issue is fixed, checks for the presence of either `version_info` or `LooseVersion` and performs the comparison.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the string comparison issue is present.
7. Prints "Issue resolved" if the proposed solution is present and works correctly.
8. Prints "Other issues" if there are any deviations or exceptions from the expected behavior.

This test can be used to verify both the current issue and the implementation of the proposed solution.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports the `matplotlib` module.
2. **Reproduce Issue**: The test checks for a `version_info` attribute or a `LooseVersion` instance in the `matplotlib` module.
3. **Outcome Messages**:
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if `matplotlib` has `version_info` or `LooseVersion` and they match the version.
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if `matplotlib` lacks both `version_info` and `LooseVersion`.
   - Prints "Other issues" if any exceptions are raised during the test execution.

### Note:
This test is designed to verify the implementation of a new feature as requested by the issue. Before running this, ensure any proposed changes for adding `version_info` or `LooseVersion` to `matplotlib` are implemented properly.

test_version_comparability()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Import the `matplotlib` library to gain access to its version information.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - Retrieve the `__version__` string from `matplotlib`.
    - Attempt to convert the version string into a tuple of integers.
    - Compare the tuple with a hypothetical version number (3, 10) to check for comparability.
3. **Outcome handling**:
    - If the conversion to a tuple is successful and the comparison behavior is as expected, print "Issue reproduced".
    - If the version tuple comparison is already correctly possible, print "Issue resolved".
    - If any other exceptions or issues occur, print "Other issues".

This test script checks whether the current version string can be converted into a tuple of integers and be compared reliably. If the tuple comparison accurately reflects the versioning, you won't need to implement additional versioning features. If not, the issue still exists and will be marked as reproduced.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test first checks the current implementation for `__version__`. Then it checks the presence of `version_info` and `LooseVersion` which are the proposed features in the issue.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If `version_info` is present and is a tuple, or if `LooseVersion` is present and is an instance of `LooseVersion`, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If neither `version_info` nor `LooseVersion` are present, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If there are any other issues (e.g., exceptions), it prints "Other issues".

If everything works as expected, it indicates that the issue has been resolved. Any other exceptions will print "Other issues".

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import `matplotlib` at the beginning to access its attributes.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - We first check if `matplotlib` has the `__version__` attribute. This is a basic check to ensure the test is correctly interacting with the `matplotlib` package.
    - Then, we check if `version_info` or `LooseVersion` attributes exist. According to the issue, these are not currently exposed.
3. **Print Statements**:
    - If neither `version_info` nor `LooseVersion` is present, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If either of these is present, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If any other error(s) occur during the execution, it prints "Other issues".

### Usage:
This test can be used to verify both the presence of the issue and its resolution. If you add the missing attributes (`version_info` or `LooseVersion`) to the `matplotlib` package, the test will then print "Issue resolved", indicating the issue has been fixed.

Explanation:
1. **Import:** We import `LooseVersion` from `distutils.version` to verify if the version information can be properly compared.
2. **Check Version Info:** We try to create a `LooseVersion` instance using `matplotlib.__version__`. If this works without exceptions, we consider the issue resolved.
3. **Catch AttributeError:** If `matplotlib` does not have the necessary attributes, it will raise an `AttributeError`, indicating the issue is reproduced as described.
4. **Catch Other Exceptions:** If any other exceptions are raised, they are caught and labeled as "Other issues".

This test will help in verifying whether the issue of adding easily comparable version info to the top level has been resolved or if it still persists.
