is_upper() raises IndexError for tall matrices
The function Matrix.is_upper raises an IndexError for a 4x2 matrix of zeros.
```

The code for is_upper() is
```
        return all(self[i, j].is_zero
                   for i in range(1, self.rows)
                   for j in range(i))
```
For a 4x2 matrix, is_upper iterates over the indices:
```
>>> A = sympy.zeros(4, 2)
>>> print tuple([i, j] for i in range(1, A.rows) for j in range(i))
([1, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2])
```
The attempt to index the (3,2) entry appears to be the source of the error.

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])

4. **Condition Handling**:
   - If an `IndexError` with "Index out of range" is raised, print "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception is raised, print "Other issues" with the exception details.
   - If no exception is raised, print "Issue resolved".

Explanation of the generated test:
1. **Imports**: Import necessary modules from `sympy`.
2. **Matrix Creation**: Create a 4x2 matrix of zeros using `sympy.zeros(4, 2)`.
3. **Try-Except Block**: Attempt to access `is_upper` property of the matrix and handle exceptions.
   - If an `IndexError` occurs with the specific message "Index out of range: a[2]", print "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other `IndexError` or any other exception occurs, print "Other issues".
   - If no exception occurs, print "Issue resolved". 

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify if the issue has been fixed.
2025-05-03 14:28:38,014 - INFO - raw output:
Certainly! Below is the complete test code to reproduce the issue as described, which also verifies whether the issue has been fixed or if there are other issues.

```python
from sympy import zeros

def test_is_upper_issue():
    try:
        # Code to reproduce the issue
        A = zeros(4, 2)
        _ = A.is_upper

    print("Issue resolved")

test_is_upper_issue()
```

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary `zeros` function is imported from the `sympy` module.
2. **Reproduction Code**: An attempt is made to create a 4x2 matrix of zeros and access the `is_upper` property. 
3. **Error Handling**:
   - If an `IndexError` is caught and the specific message matches "Index out of range: a[2]", it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception is caught, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Successful Execution**: If no exception is thrown, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test code will help you verify if the issue described is still present, has been fixed, or if there are any other problems with the source code.

test_matrix_is_upper()
```

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import `zeros` from `sympy`.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: We create a 4x2 zero matrix and try to access its `is_upper` property.
3. **Different Outcomes**:
   - If the code raises an `IndexError` with the message "Index out of range", we print "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception is raised, we print "Other issues".
   - If no exception is raised, we print "Issue resolved".

This test should correctly identify whether the issue is still present or has been fixed.
