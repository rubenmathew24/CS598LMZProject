### Description
I have a test like this:
```
from pytest import fixture


def t(foo):
    return foo


@fixture
def foo():
    return 1


def test_right_statement(foo):
    assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)

    @t
    def inner():
        return 2

    assert 2 == inner


@t
def outer():
    return 2
```
The test "test_right_statement" fails at the first assertion,but print extra code (the "t" decorator) in error details, like this:

This test script is designed to:
1. Reproduce the issue with the error message printing extra code lines when using `assert` in Python 3.9.
2. Check the Python version to determine if the issue is specific to Python 3.9.
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the error message contains the extra code line.
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the error message does not contain the extra code line in Python versions other than 3.9.
5. Print "Other issues" if it encounters any other unexpected behavior.

Explanation:
1. Imported necessary `pytest` module.
2. Defined the `t` function to match the issue description.
3. Defined the `foo` fixture.
4. Created the `test_right_statement` function to reproduce the issue.
5. Added a `try-except` block in `test_right_statement` to handle and check specific assertion error messages.
6. Added a `test_version_specific_behavior` function to run the test against specific Python versions.
7. Added a check for Python version to ensure the test runs under the specified conditions.
8. Used `pytest.main([__file__])` to run the tests when executed directly.

This script will print "Issue reproduced" if the described issue occurs, "Issue resolved" if the issue does not occur and all assertions pass, and "Other issues" if there are any other unexpected issues.

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: Included necessary imports from `pytest`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: Used the provided code to set up the fixture and test function.
3. **Print Statements**:
    - Added a try-except block around the assert statement to catch the `AssertionError`.
    - In the except block, used `traceback.format_exc()` to capture the traceback and checked if the extra code line (the decorator `@t`) is in the error message.
    - Printed "Issue reproduced" if the extra code line is present, otherwise printed "Other issues".
4. **Pytest Main Call**: Included a call to `pytest.main` to allow running the test directly.

This test script will help to verify whether the issue is present and can be used to check if it gets resolved in future.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Imported `pytest` for fixture and decorator usage.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Added a fixture `foo`, decorator `t`, and test function `test_right_statement` which contains the code provided in the issue.
3. **Outcome handling**: Used try-except to catch the `AssertionError` and check if the error message contains the specific strings indicating the issue (i.e., the assertion error and the decorator code). Based on the outcome, it prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues".

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules and fixtures.
2. Defines the code to reproduce the issue.
3. Checks if the issue described (extra code line in the error message) is present when using Python 3.9.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the extra code line appears in the error message.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the code does not show the extra code line in Python versions other than 3.9.
6. Prints "Other issues" if any other unexpected issue occurs.

To run the test, simply execute the script, and it will determine whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

**Instructions:**
1. Save this script to a file, e.g., `test_issue.py`.
2. Run the file using Python with pytest installed. For example:
   ```sh
   python test_issue.py
   ```
3. Observe the printed output to determine if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues with the code.

This test script tries to reproduce the issue by running the provided test case and analyzing the output. If it detects the extra line with the `@t` decorator in the error message, it will print "Issue reproduced". If it does not see the extra line, it will print "Issue resolved". Any other assertion errors will result in "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. The test imports `pytest`.
2. Defines the `t` function and `foo` fixture as described.
3. The `test_right_statement` function attempts to reproduce the issue and catches the `AssertionError`.
4. If the error message matches the issue described (`assert 1 == 75`), it prints "Issue reproduced".
5. If any other assertion error is caught, it prints "Other issues".
6. If no assertion error is caught, it prints "Issue resolved".
7. The script runs the test using `pytest.main([__file__])` when executed directly.

Here's what the script does:

1. Imports necessary modules and functions.
2. Defines the decorator `t`.
3. Defines the fixture `foo`.
4. Defines the test function `test_right_statement` to reproduce the issue.
5. Defines an additional decorator usage to match the structure of the issue.
6. Defines a function `run_test` to run the test with pytest and determine the outcome based on the exit code.
    - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the test fails and the issue is reproduced.
    - Prints "Issue resolved" if the test passes.

This code sets up a test that reproduces the issue described in the issue text. It checks if the error message contains the extra code (the "t" decorator) when running in Python 3.9 or later, which indicates that the issue is reproduced. If the error message does not contain the extra code in Python 3.7, it indicates the issue is resolved. If there are other discrepancies, it will print "Other issues".

test_right_statement(foo)
```

Explanation:
1. The function `t` and fixture `foo` are imported and defined as per the issue.
2. The `test_right_statement` function is exactly as described in the issue.
3. The test is wrapped in a try-except block to handle the assertion error.
4. The error message is checked to see if it contains both '1 == 75' and '@t', which indicates the reproduction of the issue described.
5. Depending on the check, the appropriate message ("Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues") is printed.

This test script should be able to reproduce the issue if it exists and also indicate when it has been resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Imported `fixture` and `main` from `pytest`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - Defined the decorator `t`.
    - Created a fixture `foo`.
    - Created the test function `test_right_statement` that includes the problematic assertion and the decorator `t`.
3. **Print statements**:
    - If the error message contains both `assert 1 == 75` and `@t`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If the error message contains only `assert 1 == 75` without the extra line, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If the error message contains neither, it prints "Other issues".

To run the test, execute this script in an environment where `pytest` is installed. This script will help determine if the issue described in the issue text is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

This script contains the necessary imports, code to reproduce the issue, and logic to print the appropriate messages based on the outcome. The script should be run in an environment where you can observe the printed output to understand if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues. 

To use this test, copy the code into a file, say `test_issue.py`, and run it using Python 3.9 to see if the issue is reproduced. Make sure `pytest` is installed in your Python environment.

This test script does the following:

1. Imports the necessary components from `pytest`.
2. Defines the decorator function `t` and the fixture `foo`.
3. Implements the `test_right_statement` function which contains the code provided in the issue description.
4. Uses a try-except block to catch the `AssertionError` and checks if the error message matches the described issue, indicating the issue is reproduced in Python 3.9.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific issue with the extra code line is detected for Python 3.9.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if the assertions pass, indicating the issue has been fixed.
7. Prints "Other issues" if any other issues are detected.

After defining `test_right_statement`, it invokes the function to run the test.
