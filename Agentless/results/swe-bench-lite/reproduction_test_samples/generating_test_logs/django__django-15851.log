We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
dbshell additional parameters should be passed before dbname on PostgreSQL.
Description
	
psql expects all options to proceed the database name, if provided. So, if doing something like `./manage.py dbshell -- -c "select * from some_table;" one will get this:
$ ./manage.py dbshell -- -c "select * from some_table;"
psql: warning: extra command-line argument "-c" ignored
psql: warning: extra command-line argument "select * from some_table;" ignored
psql (10.21)
Type "help" for help.

It appears the args list just need to be constructed in the proper order, leaving the database name for the end of the args list.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**:
   - `subprocess` is used to run the command as if it were run from the command line.
   - `sys` is used to get the current Python executable.

2. **Reproduction Code**:
   - `subprocess.run` is used to simulate running the `manage.py dbshell` command with additional args.
   - The `capture_output=True` and `text=True` parameters ensure that the output and errors are captured as text for easy checking.

3. **Outcome Checks**:
   - The code checks if the warning messages about extra command-line arguments being ignored are present in `stderr`.
   - If the warnings are found, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating that the issue is still present.
   - If the warnings are not found, it prints "Issue resolved", indicating that the issue might have been fixed.
   - If there is an exception or any other issue, it prints "Other issues" and provides the exception message.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been fixed.

Here's a breakdown of the test:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports `subprocess` to run the command and `sys` to use the current Python executable.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - Defines the path to `manage.py`.
    - Constructs the dbshell command with additional parameters before the database name.
3. **Outcome verification**:
    - If the `stderr` contains the expected issue warnings, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If no warnings are found, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

The test should be adjusted as needed to match the actual environment and paths where the issue is being tested.

Here's what this script does:

1. **Imports necessary module**: It imports `subprocess` to run the command that reproduces the issue.
2. **Defines the test function**: The function `test_dbshell_additional_parameters` contains the logic to reproduce and check for the issue.
3. **Forms the command**: It creates the command list to run the `dbshell` command with additional parameters in the incorrect order.
4. **Runs the command**: Uses `subprocess.run` to execute the command and captures the output.
5. **Checks for the issue**: If the output contains the specific warnings about extra command-line arguments, it prints "Issue reproduced". If no such warnings are found, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. **Handles exceptions**: If any other issues occur (e.g., `subprocess` fails to run the command), it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.

This test can be used to verify both the reproduction of the issue and its resolution.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import `subprocess` for running shell commands and `os` for file operations.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - We create a temporary SQL file `test_query.sql` with the dummy query `select * from some_table;`.
    - We set up the command to run `./manage.py dbshell -- -f test_query.sql your_database_name`.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
    - If "extra command-line argument" is found in `stderr`, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
    - If the typical output of `psql` without errors is found, it indicates the issue is resolved.
    - Otherwise, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Clean-up**: The temporary file `test_query.sql` is deleted after the test.

Replace `your_database_name` with the actual name of your database and adjust the path to `psql` if necessary.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:**
   - `subprocess` is imported to run the shell command and capture its output.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - The function `test_dbshell_additional_parameters()` attempts to run the `manage.py dbshell` command with additional parameters before the database name.
   - `subprocess.run()` is used to execute the command and capture both stdout and stderr.

3. **Outcome Checks:**
   - If the stderr contains the warning messages about extra command-line arguments, the issue is reproduced.
   - If the command completes successfully and the expected PostgreSQL prompt appears, the issue is resolved.
   - Any other outcome is considered to indicate other issues.

4. **Output Messages:**
   - The function prints "Issue reproduced" if the issue is detected.
   - It prints "Issue resolved" if no errors are found and the command runs as expected.
   - It prints "Other issues" if there's a different problem or if an exception occurs during the test execution.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The `subprocess` module is imported to run the command and capture its output. The `sys` module is imported to use the Python interpreter executable dynamically.
2. **Command**: The command to run the `manage.py dbshell` with the parameters as described in the issue is constructed.
3. **Execution**: The `subprocess.Popen` function is used to execute the command and capture both `stdout` and `stderr`.
4. **Checking Output**: The captured `stderr` is checked for the presence of the specific warning messages that indicate the issue. The captured `stdout` is used to check for the psql prompt, which would only appear if the command was executed correctly.
5. **Result**: Depending on the output, the corresponding message is printed.

This script can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been resolved.

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**:
   - `subprocess` is used for running the command and capturing its output.
   - `sys` is imported but not used here; it can be removed if not needed for other extensions.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - The `test_dbshell_additional_params` function constructs the command as defined in the issue.
   - `subprocess.run` is used to execute the command and capture both stdout and stderr.

3. **Handling Results**:
   - The script checks if the output contains the warning about ignored command-line arguments.
   - If the warnings are present, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the command completes successfully, it checks if the psql prompt (`some_database=>`) is shown, indicating the issue is resolved.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "Other issues".

4. **Execution**:
   - The function is called to execute the test.

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Imports and Environment Setup**: The `subprocess` module is imported to run the command, and environment variables for `PGUSER` and `PGPASSWORD` are set up to allow `psql` to connect to the database without prompting for a password.
2. **Command Construction**: The command to run `./manage.py dbshell -- -c "select * from some_table;"` is constructed in a list.
3. **Running the Command**: The command is run with `subprocess.run`, capturing both stdout and stderr.
4. **Checking for Issue Reproduction**: If the stderr output contains the warning about extra command-line arguments, then the issue is reproduced.
5. **Checking for Issue Resolution**: If the stdout contains the expected table output, then the issue is resolved.
6. **Handling Other Issues**: Any other unexpected output or exceptions are categorized as "Other issues".

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The `subprocess` module is imported to run shell commands from within the Python script.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The command `./manage.py dbshell -- -c "select * from some_table;"` is constructed as a list.
   - `subprocess.run` is used to execute the command, capturing the output and error messages.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the standard error (`stderr`) contains "extra command-line argument", it indicates the issue is reproduced.
   - If the return code of the command is `0` (indicating successful execution without errors) and no warnings are found, it indicates the issue is resolved.
   - If there are other errors or exceptions, it indicates other issues with the source code.

Make sure to have the necessary environment and dependencies set up for this test to run correctly. Adjust the `manage_py_command` to match the exact setup and structure of your `manage.py` and database configuration as needed.

### Explanation
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports the `subprocess` module necessary to run shell commands.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The `command` variable holds the command that triggers the issue.
   - `subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)` runs the command and captures the stdout and stderr outputs.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If `'extra command-line argument'` is found in `stderr`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the command executes successfully with the expected prompt `'some_database=>'` in stdout, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - For any other conditions or exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be run to both reproduce and verify the resolution of the issue.

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The `subprocess` module is used to run the command and capture its output.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - **Command Construction**: We construct the command that triggers the issue.
   - **Execution**: We use `subprocess.run()` to execute the command and capture the output.
3. **Outcome Validation**:
   - If the specific warning messages from `psql` are found in the standard error output (`result.stderr`), the issue is reproduced.
   - If the warnings are not present, the issue is considered resolved.
   - Any exceptions caught during execution are categorized under "Other issues".
4. **Print Statements**: Indicate the result of the test to clearly state if the issue was reproduced, resolved, or if there were other issues.

This test assumes that the environment is set up correctly with access to the `manage.py` script, the `psql` command, and a PostgreSQL database named `some_database`. Adjust the paths and database names if necessary.

This test does the following:
1. Imports the `subprocess` module to run the command and capture its output.
2. Defines a function `test_dbshell_argument_order` that constructs and runs the problematic command.
3. Checks the output for specific warnings about extra command-line arguments.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the warnings are found, indicating the issue is present.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the warnings are not found, indicating the issue has been fixed.
6. Prints "Other issues" if there are other exceptions or errors during the command execution.

You can run this test to verify if the issue is still present or has been resolved.

2. We capture both the standard output and standard error to check for specific warning messages that indicate the issue.
3. If the warning messages are present, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If there are no warning messages and the command executes successfully (`result.returncode == 0`), it prints "Issue resolved".
5. If an exception occurs or the return code is non-zero while not matching the expected warnings, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be used to detect whether the issue with parameter ordering in `dbshell` is still present or has been fixed.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports `subprocess` to run the command and capture its output, `sys` to handle system-specific parameters, and `os` to set environment variables.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to simulate a Django environment and constructs the command as described in the issue. 
3. **Checking the output**: The script captures the output of the command and checks for the specific warning messages in `result.stderr` to determine if the issue is reproduced.
4. **Print statements**: Depending on the presence of the warning messages, it prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues" if an exception is encountered.

Make sure to replace `'myproject.settings'` with your actual Django settings module. This test should be run in an environment where Django and PostgreSQL are correctly configured.

test_dbshell_additional_params()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import `subprocess` to run the command line process and capture its output.
2. **Command**: We define the command to include the parameters in the order specified in the issue text.
3. **Execution**: We use `subprocess.run` to execute the command and capture both `stdout` and `stderr`.
4. **Output Validation**:
   - If the warning about extra command-line arguments is found, the issue is reproduced.
   - If the desired query result appears (i.e., `SELECT 1` is executed successfully), the issue is resolved.
   - For any other output, it prints "Other issues".
5. **Error Handling**: If the subprocess fails to run (e.g., `manage.py` not found), handle it and print "Other issues".

This script should be used in an environment where you have a Django project configured and `manage.py` is properly set up to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Adjust the `manage_py_path` variable if necessary to point to the correct location of your `manage.py`.
