--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument
Currently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().

This would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.


--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2

test_hooks_issue()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** Only the `requests` library is imported, as it contains the `Request` class and `Session` needed for the test.
2. **Reproduce the Issue:** Two hook functions (`hook1` and `hook2`) are defined. A dictionary `hooks` is created with a list of these two hooks under the 'response' key, which triggers the problematic behavior.
3. **Print Outcome:**
   - If `TypeError` is raised and contains "is not callable", this indicates the issue described in the issue text.
   - If both hooks are executed and their attributes are set, it indicates that the issue has been resolved.
   - Any other exceptions are caught and printed as "Other issues".
4. **Verify the Fix:** The test will print "Issue resolved" if both hooks execute successfully and their attributes are set. Otherwise, it will print "Issue reproduced".

This test can be used both to reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been fixed in the `requests` library.

In this test:
1. The necessary imports from the `requests` library are made.
2. Two hook functions `hook1` and `hook2` are defined.
3. The `test_hooks_issue` function creates a `Request` object with multiple hooks for the 'response' event, prepares the request, and sends it using a session.
4. It checks if a `TypeError` with a message containing "not callable" is raised, which reproduces the issue.
5. If no error occurs, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test will help in verifying if the issue described is reproduced or resolved.

This test attempts to set up a `Request` with multiple hooks for the 'response' event. If the issue described in the issue text is present, it will raise a `TypeError` because the list of hooks is not properly handled. The test will print "Issue reproduced" if this specific error occurs, otherwise it will print "Other issues". If the issue is resolved and the code can properly handle multiple hooks, it will print "Other issues" as a fallback, which can be adjusted to better differentiate between resolved and unforeseen issues.

This test script should be executed within the context of your project where `Request` and its `hooks` argument are defined. The test will attempt to reproduce the issue by setting up hooks as a list, sending a request, and catching the specific `TypeError` that indicates a non-callable list was encountered. If the error is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the request completes successfully, it checks if both hooks were executed and prints "Issue resolved" or "Other issues" accordingly.

This script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules.
2. Defines two hook functions (`hook_func_1` and `hook_func_2`) that print a message when called.
3. Creates a function `test_hooks_issue` to test if the issue is reproduced or resolved:
    - It sets up a `Session` and `Request` object with a list of hooks for the 'response' event.
    - Attempts to send the prepared request.
    - Checks for exceptions to determine if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.
4. Calls the `test_hooks_issue` function to execute the test.

You can run this script to verify the behavior and check if the issue described in the issue text is reproduced.

```

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The test imports the `Request` class from the hypothetical `requests_module` where it is assumed to be defined.
2. **Hooks Definition:** Two hook functions `hook1` and `hook2` are defined. These functions modify the response object to add an attribute indicating they were called.
3. **Hooks Dictionary:** A dictionary with a key `'response'` and a value as a list of the two hook functions is created.
4. **Test Execution:** 
   - A `Request` object is instantiated with the `hooks` dictionary.
   - The `send` method of the `Request` object is called to simulate sending the request.
5. **Outcome Checking:** 
   - If the response object has both `hook1_called` and `hook2_called` attributes, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If there is a `TypeError`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
6. **Error Handling:** Any other exceptions are caught, and it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test should be able to identify if the issue described in the issue text is reproduced or resolved by checking if multiple hooks can be accepted and executed correctly.

In this test:
1. We define two hook functions, `hook_function_1` and `hook_function_2`.
2. We create a `Session` object from the `requests` library.
3. We create a `Request` object with the `hooks` parameter where the value for the 'response' key is a list of the two hook functions.
4. We send the prepared request with the session and check for a `TypeError`.
5. If a `TypeError` with "not callable" in its message is caught, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
6. If no exception is caught, it assumes the problem is resolved.
7. If any other error occurs, it prints "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: We import `Request` and `Session` from the `requests` library.
2. **Hook Functions**: Two dummy hook functions (`hook_func_1` and `hook_func_2`) are defined for testing purposes.
3. **Test Function**:
    - A new `Session` is created.
    - A hooks dictionary is constructed with a list containing `hook_func_1` and `hook_func_2`.
    - A `Request` object is created using the hooks dictionary.
    - The request is prepared and sent using the session.
    - If there is no issue with the hooks, "Issue resolved" will be printed.
    - If a `TypeError` occurs with the message indicating the list is not callable, "Issue reproduced" will be printed.
    - Any other exceptions will print "Other issues" and the exception message.

This test will help in reproducing the issue when multiple hooks are provided in a list and can also be used to verify once the issue is resolved.

Explanation:
1. The `Request` class is a mock representation that mimics the behavior described in the issue text.
2. The test function `test_hooks_issue`:
   - Defines two hook functions: `hook_1` and `hook_2`.
   - Passes a dictionary with a list of hooks to the `Request` class.
   - Attempts to send the request and prints the appropriate message based on the outcome.
3. The test checks for the specific `ValueError` to determine if the issue has been reproduced.
4. If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".
5. If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be used to reproduce and verify if the issue described in the issue text has been resolved.

2. Defines hook functions (`hook_function_1` and `hook_function_2`) that modify the response object.
3. Creates a test function `test_hooks_with_list()` which:
   - Creates a session.
   - Creates a `Request` object with hooks containing lists.
   - Prepares and sends the request.
   - Checks if the hooks were called and sets attributes on the response object.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if both hooks are called, "Issue reproduced" if they are not called, and "Other issues" if an exception occurs.

   - Sets up a `Request` object with a dictionary of hooks where the value is a list of functions.
   - Prepares and sends the request using a `Session`.
   - Checks if the hooks are correctly called.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the hooks are processed correctly.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific type error is raised.
6. Prints "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The necessary imports for `Request`, `Session`, and hooks are included.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Created two hook functions (`hook_1` and `hook_2`) and passed them in a list to the `hooks` dictionary.
3. **Print statements to indicate the outcome**: Depending on the outcome, the code prints "Issue resolved", "Issue reproduced", or "Other issues".

This test should be able to reproduce the issue by demonstrating the TypeError when trying to use a list of hooks. If the issue is fixed, the code should execute without any errors and print "Issue resolved".

        print("Other issues:", e)

test_hooks_list_in_dict_values()
```

This script does the following:
1. Defines two hook functions (`hook_1` and `hook_2`).
2. Creates a dictionary with a list of these hooks as the value for the 'response' key.
3. Attempts to create a `Request` object with this dictionary as the `hooks` argument and then sends the request.
4. Checks if the hooks were called by looking for attributes set by the hook functions on the response.

Based on the issue description, this should cause an error when trying to send the request, thus reproducing the issue. If the issue is resolved, the hooks should be called without errors.

### Explanation

1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports `Request` and `Session` from the `requests` library.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - We define a simple hook function `example_hook`.
   - We create a session object.
   - We define a dictionary `hooks` with a list of hook functions for the key `'response'`.
   - We create a `Request` object with these hooks.
   - We prepare and send the request, which should trigger the hooks.
3. **Print Statements**:
   - If the code runs successfully without wrapping the list in another list, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the `TypeError` related to a list not being callable is encountered, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception occurs, it catches it and prints "Other issues".

This test should be able to both reproduce the described issue and verify if the issue has been fixed.

4. Attempt to send the request and handle the response.
5. Print "Issue resolved" if no exception occurs, indicating the hooks have been successfully parsed.
6. Print "Issue reproduced" if a `TypeError` is raised due to the list not being callable.
7. Print "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised.
