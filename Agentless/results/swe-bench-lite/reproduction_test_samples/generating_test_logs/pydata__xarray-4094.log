--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
to_unstacked_dataset broken for single-dim variables
<!-- A short summary of the issue, if appropriate -->


#### MCVE Code Sample

```python
arr = xr.DataArray(
     np.arange(3),
     coords=[("x", [0, 1, 2])],
 )
data = xr.Dataset({"a": arr, "b": arr})
stacked = data.to_stacked_array('y', sample_dims=['x'])
unstacked = stacked.to_unstacked_dataset('y')
# MergeError: conflicting values for variable 'y' on objects to be combined. You can skip this check by specifying compat='override'.
```

#### Expected Output
A working roundtrip.

#### Problem Description
I need to stack a bunch of variables and later unstack them again, however this doesn't work if the variables only have a single dimension.

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The necessary imports for `numpy` and `xarray`.
2. **Test Function**: The function `test_to_unstacked_dataset_issue()` wraps the test code.
3. **Data Creation**: Sample data is created using `xr.DataArray` and `xr.Dataset`.
4. **Stack**: The dataset is stacked using `to_stacked_array`.
5. **Unstack**: Attempt to unstack the dataset using `to_unstacked_dataset`.
6. **Exception Handling**: 
   - If the specific `xr.MergeError` with the known message is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues" followed by the exception message.
7. **Issue Resolved**: If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

You can run this script to test if the issue is reproduced or resolved. If there are other issues with the code, they will be indicated as well.

2. Sets up the `DataArray` and `Dataset` as described in the issue text.
3. Stacks the `Dataset`.
4. Attempts to unstack the `Dataset`.
5. Checks for the specific error message mentioned in the issue text to determine if the issue is reproduced.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific error is encountered, "Other issues" if any other exception is raised, and "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised.

test_to_unstacked_dataset_single_dim_vars()
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports necessary libraries (`numpy` and `xarray`).
2. Defines a function `test_to_unstacked_dataset_single_dim_vars` to reproduce the issue.
3. Inside the function:
   - Creates a `DataArray` with a single dimension.
   - Creates a `Dataset` containing this `DataArray`.
   - Stacks the dataset and then attempts to unstack it.
4. Catches the specific `MergeError` and checks if it matches the description from the issue text.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the error matches, "Other issues" if a different error occurs, and "Issue resolved" if no error occurs.

Run the test function to see if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: `numpy` for array creation and `xarray` for dataset manipulation.
2. **Reproduction Code**: The code creates a DataArray, uses it to form a Dataset, stacks the Dataset, and attempts to unstack it again.
3. **Print Statements**:
   - `"Issue resolved"` if the roundtrip operation works without raising an error.
   - `"Issue reproduced"` if a specific `MergeError` is raised, indicating the issue is still present.
   - `"Other issues"` for any other exceptions that might be raised during execution.

This test script should help in reproducing the issue as well as verifying if the issue has been resolved. The script follows these steps:

1. Imports the necessary libraries.
2. Creates a simple `DataArray` and places it in a `Dataset`.
3. Stacks the dataset using `to_stacked_array`.
4. Attempts to unstack the dataset using `to_unstacked_dataset`.
5. Catches specific exceptions to determine if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

Explanation of the test:
1. Necessary imports are included at the top.
2. The test function `test_to_unstacked_dataset_single_dim_vars` is defined to reproduce the issue.
3. The provided code snippet is included within a try-except block to catch the specific `xr.MergeError` indicating the issue.
4. Three outcomes are considered:
   - If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the specific `MergeError` related to conflicting values for variable 'y' is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".

This test function follows the structure provided. It attempts to reproduce the issue by running the code snippet from the issue and checks the outcome:

1. **Imports the necessary modules** (`xarray` and `numpy`).
2. **Sets up the code to reproduce the issue** by creating a sample dataset, stacking it, and attempting to unstack it.
3. It catches known issues related to the exception and prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific error occurs.
4. If the operation works successfully and the unstacked dataset matches the original, it prints "Issue resolved".
5. Any other exceptions are caught, and it prints "Other issues".

This test should help to identify if the issue still exists or if it has been resolved.

This script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules (`numpy`, `xarray`, and `MergeError` from `xarray.core.merge` for error handling).
2. Defines a function `test_to_unstacked_dataset_single_dim` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Creates a `DataArray` and a `Dataset` with single-dimension variables.
4. Converts the dataset to a stacked array.
5. Attempts to convert the stacked array back to an unstacked dataset.
6. Catches specific exceptions to print appropriate messages:
   - "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised.
   - "Issue reproduced" if a `MergeError` is raised.
   - "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

Running this test will help determine if the issue persists or has been resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary libraries (`numpy` and `xarray`) are imported.
2. **Code to Reproduce Issue**: Followed the provided MCVE (Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example) to reproduce the issue.
3. **Print Statements**: Used print statements to indicate if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.
4. **Exception Handling**: Specifically caught `xr.MergeError` to check if the issue described in the issue text is reproduced. If another error occurs or no error occurs, print "Other issues" or "Issue resolved" accordingly.
