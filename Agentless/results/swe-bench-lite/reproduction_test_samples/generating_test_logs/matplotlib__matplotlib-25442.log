--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
[Bug]: Attribute Error combining matplotlib 3.7.1 and mplcursor on data selection
### Bug summary

If you combine mplcursor and matplotlib 3.7.1, you'll get an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'` after clicking a few data points. Henceforth, selecting a new data point will trigger the same traceback. Otherwise, it works fine. 

### Code for reproduction

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mplcursors as mpl

x = np.arange(1, 11)    
y1 = x

plt.scatter(x,y1)

mpl.cursor()
plt.show()
```


### Actual outcome

```

### Explanation

1. **Necessary Imports**: The test starts by importing the necessary libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mplcursors`).
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The code from the issue text is used to reproduce the problem. It creates a simple scatter plot and enables `mpl.cursor()`.
3. **Error Handling**:
    - If an `AttributeError` is raised and it matches the specific error message described in the issue (`'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'`), it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If any other `AttributeError` or any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Successful Execution**: If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test script can be used to check if the issue still exists or if it has been resolved in future versions.

Explanation:
1. The necessary imports have been included: `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mplcursors`.
2. The code to reproduce the issue is wrapped in a function called `test_mplcursor_matplotlib`.
3. If an `AttributeError` with the message `"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'"` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If any other kind of exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
5. If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

```

Explanation:
1. The test script imports the required libraries and sets up the initial conditions described in the issue.
2. It defines a `test_mplcursor_matplotlib_interaction()` function to encapsulate the test logic.
3. The function creates a scatter plot and attaches a cursor using `mpl.cursor()`.
4. It sets up an event handler for mouse clicks and programmatically triggers a few click events to simulate user interaction.
5. The function checks for the `AttributeError` mentioned in the issue and prints "Issue reproduced" if the error occurs.
6. If no errors occur, it prints "Issue resolved".
7. Any other exceptions result in printing "Other issues".
8. The interactive mode is enabled and disabled appropriately to allow dynamic updates and ensure proper cleanup.

This script can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify whether it has been fixed.

Sure, here is a complete test script that can be used to reproduce the issue described in the issue text:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mplcursors as mpl

def test_mplcursor_matplotlib_issue():
    try:
        # Reproducing the issue
        x = np.arange(1, 11)    
        y1 = x

        plt.scatter(x, y1)
        mpl.cursor()
        plt.show()
        
        # If no exception occurs, print "Issue resolved"
        print("Issue resolved")
        
    except AttributeError as e:
        # Checking for the specific issue
        if "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'" in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced")
        else:

    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other exceptions
        print("Other issues")

# Run the test function
test_mplcursor_matplotlib_issue()
```

This test script tries to reproduce the issue by running the provided code. If the AttributeError related to 'NoneType' and 'canvas' occurs, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the script runs without errors, it prints "Issue resolved". For any other exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

```

This test script performs the following:
1. Imports necessary packages.
2. Defines a function `test_attribute_error_with_mplcursor` to encapsulate the logic.
3. Inside the function, it reproduces the issue by plotting a scatter plot and using `mplcursors` to simulate data point selections.
4. Simulates mouse clicks on the data points to trigger the error.
5. Catches the `AttributeError` and checks if it matches the issue described.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the error matches the issue, "Other issues" for other exceptions, and "Issue resolved" if no error occurs.

You can run this script to test whether the issue is reproduced or resolved in your environment.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_mpl_cursor_issue()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports**: Import necessary libraries including `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mplcursors`.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text**:
    - Data is generated using `np.arange()` and plotted using `plt.scatter()`.
    - `mplcursors.cursor()` is used to enable data selection.
    - `plt.show()` is used to display the plot.
  
3. **Print statements**: 
    - `print("Please click on a few data points to trigger the issue...")` prompts user interaction.
    - Exceptions are caught to determine if the issue is reproduced or if other issues are present.
    - If an `AttributeError` is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If any other exception is caught, it prints "Other issues".

4. **Function and call**: `test_mpl_cursor_issue()` is defined to encapsulate the test logic and is called in the `__main__` block to execute the test.

This test script allows for both reproducing the issue and verifying if the issue has been fixed, based on the absence or presence of the `AttributeError`.

Certainly! Below is the complete test wrapped in Python code. It includes the necessary imports, the code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text, and conditions to print the appropriate messages based on the outcome.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mplcursors as mpl

def test_matplotlib_mplcursor_issue():
    try:
        x = np.arange(1, 11)
        y1 = x

        plt.scatter(x, y1)

        mpl.cursor()

            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

test_matplotlib_mplcursor_issue()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** The code imports `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mplcursors`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** The code sets up a simple scatter plot and enables the mplcursors.
3. **Handling Exceptions:**
   - If an `AttributeError` occurs and matches the specific error message related to the issue (`'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'`), it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other `AttributeError` or general `Exception` occurs, it prints "Other issues".
   - If no exceptions occur, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test can be used to verify if the issue is still present or has been fixed.

```

Explanation:
1. The code imports necessary libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mplcursors`.
2. It defines a function `test_mplcursor_attribute_error()` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Inside the function:
   - Data is generated and plotted using `plt.scatter()`.
   - A cursor is created using `mpl.cursor()`.
   - An event connection is made to detect button press events.
   - The plot is displayed using `plt.show()`.
4. After the plot is closed, it tries to disconnect events using `cursor.disconnect_events()`.
5. Depending on whether the `AttributeError` with the specific message is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced". Otherwise, it catches and prints any other exception messages as "Other issues".
6. If no exceptions are raised, it prints "Issue resolved".
7. The function is executed in the main block to ensure it runs when the script is executed.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mplcursors` as required to reproduce the issue.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - Creates a simple scatter plot using `matplotlib.pyplot.scatter`.
   - Uses `mplcursors.cursor()` to enable interaction.
   - Displays the plot with `plt.show()`.
3. **Exception Handling**:
   - If the specific `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` and `canvas` is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other `AttributeError` is caught, it prints "Other issues".
   - If no exception is caught, it prints "No exception occurred - Issue resolved".
   - Any other types of exceptions are also caught and logged as "Other issues" with the exception message. 

This script functions as both a reproducer of the issue and a verifier for its resolution.

Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The necessary libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `mplcursors`) are imported.
2. **Function Definition**: A function `test_mplcursor_with_matplotlib()` is defined to encapsulate the test logic.
3. **Test Code**: The code inside the `try` block replicates the provided issue code. It creates a scatter plot and sets up `mplcursor`.
4. **Exception Handling**:
   - If an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other `AttributeError` is raised, it prints "Other issues".
   - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues" with the exception message.
5. **No Exception**: If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test will help you determine whether the issue still exists, has been resolved, or if there are other issues in the code.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: Imports `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `mplcursors`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Creates a scatter plot with `matplotlib`.
   - Activates the `mplcursor`.
3. **Print Statements**:
   - Use try-except blocks to handle the specific `AttributeError` mentioned and any other exceptions.
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific `AttributeError` is caught.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised.
   - Prints "Other issues" if other types of exceptions are encountered.
4. **Manual Interaction**:
   - Since simulating clicks programmatically within a non-interactive script is complex, the script allows for manual interaction with the plot to trigger the error in an interactive environment.

This test is designed to be run in an environment where the user can manually interact with the plot to reproduce the issue. For automated testing, additional tools to simulate GUI interactions would be required.
