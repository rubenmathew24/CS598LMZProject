--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot
This is required since every dot is now significant since blueprints can be nested. An error was already added for endpoint names in 1.0, but should have been added for this as well.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

In this test, we create a Flask application and try to register a blueprint with a name containing a dot. According to the issue description, this should raise an error. If the error is raised and the error message contains "Blueprint names should not contain dots", we print "Issue resolved". If a different error is raised or no error is raised, we print "Issue reproduced" or "Other issues", respectively.

```
In this test:

1. Necessary imports are included: `Flask` and `Blueprint` from the `flask` package.
2. The code attempts to create and register a blueprint with a dot in its name, which according to the issue text, should not be allowed.
3. If the blueprint is registered without raising an error, it prints "Issue reproduced," indicating that the issue still exists.
4. If a `ValueError` is raised with the expected error message, it prints "Issue resolved," indicating that the issue has been fixed.
5. If an unexpected exception is raised, it prints "Other issues," indicating that there might be other issues with the source code.

Explanation:
1. The test imports necessary modules from `flask`.
2. It tries to create a `Blueprint` with a dot in its name and register it with the `Flask` app.
3. If a `ValueError` with a specific message is raised, it indicates the issue has been reproduced.
4. If any other exception is raised, it indicates there are other issues.
5. If no exception is raised, it indicates the issue has been resolved.

        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

test_blueprint_name_with_dot()
```

In this test:
1. We import the necessary components (`Flask` and `Blueprint`).
2. We create a Flask app and attempt to create and register a blueprint with a dot in its name.
3. If it raises a `ValueError` with the expected message, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. If it raises a different error, it prints "Other issues" along with the error message.
5. If it successfully creates and registers the blueprint (indicating the issue is still present), it prints "Issue reproduced".

This test attempts to register a blueprint with a name containing a dot, which should raise a `ValueError` if the issue is resolved. The test prints "Issue reproduced" if no error is raised (indicating the issue still exists), "Issue resolved" if the correct error is raised, and "Other issues" for other exceptions or error messages.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary imports for Flask and Blueprint.
2. **Reproducing the Issue**: 
    - Create an instance of a `Flask` application.
    - Attempt to create and register a `Blueprint` with a name containing a dot.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
    - If no error is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If a `ValueError` is raised and it specifically mentions that the blueprint name should not contain a dot, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - For other exceptions or if the `ValueError` raised is for a different reason, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be used to verify if the issue of allowing blueprint names with dots is still present or has been resolved.

Certainly! Below is a complete test for reproducing the issue described in the issue text. This test will create a Flask application, attempt to register a blueprint with a dot in its name, and check for the appropriate error.

```python
from flask import Flask, Blueprint

def test_blueprint_name_with_dot():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    try:
        # Attempt to create a blueprint with a dot in its name
        blueprint = Blueprint('blue.print', __name__)
        app.register_blueprint(blueprint)
        print("Issue reproduced")
    except ValueError as e:
        # Check if the error is specific to the blueprint name containing a dot
        if 'Blueprint names should not contain dots' in str(e):
            print("Issue resolved")
        else:
            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

test_blueprint_name_with_dot()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports**: Only `Flask` and `Blueprint` are imported from the `flask` module.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test attempts to create a blueprint with a dot in its name (`'blue.print'`) and register it with the Flask application.
3. **Print statements**:
   - "Issue reproduced": Printed if no exception is raised, indicating that the blueprint with a dot in its name was incorrectly allowed.
   - "Issue resolved": Printed if a `ValueError` is raised with the specific message indicating the blueprint name should not contain dots.
   - "Other issues": Printed if a different exception is raised or if the `ValueError` contains an unexpected message.

This test will help to verify if the issue described in the provided issue text has been reproduced or resolved.
