--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Missing parameter validation in Neighbors estimator for float n_neighbors
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
X, y = make_blobs()
neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3.)
neighbors.fit(X)
neighbors.kneighbors(X)
```
```
~/checkout/scikit-learn/sklearn/neighbors/binary_tree.pxi in sklearn.neighbors.kd_tree.NeighborsHeap.__init__()

TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```
This should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised (or we could be lenient and cast to integer, but I think a better error might be better).

We need to make sure that 
```python
neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)
```
also works.

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."

        return

    return

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.

Here is a breakdown of the test:\n\n1. **Imports**: The necessary modules are imported at the beginning.\n2. **Code to Reproduce**: The test creates a dataset using `make_blobs`, initializes `NearestNeighbors` with a float `n_neighbors`, fits the data, and then calls `kneighbors`.\n3. **Exception Handling**: The test captures the `TypeError` and checks its message to print "Issue reproduced" if the error message matches the expected issue. If any other exception or type of issue is encountered, it prints "Other issues".\n4. **No Exception**: If no exception is raised, the test prints "Issue resolved".\n\nYou can run this test to see if the issue is reproduced or if it has been resolved after the necessary changes are made to the code.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)), Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=8, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\ndef test_neighbors_estimator_float_n_neighbors() -> None:\n    try:\n        X, y = make_blobs()\n        neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3.)\n        neighbors.fit(X)\n        neighbors.kneighbors(X)\n        print("Issue resolved")\n    except TypeError as e:\n        if "\'float\' object cannot be interpreted as an integer" in str(e):\n            print("Issue reproduced")\n        else:\n            print("Other issues")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f"Other issues: {e}")\n\n# Run the test\ntest_neighbors_estimator_float_n_neighbors()\n```\n\nThis test script will help you reproduce the issue by trying to execute the code with a float value for `n_neighbors` and handle the `TypeError` as specified.

This test script includes the necessary imports, the code to reproduce the issue, and the print statements to indicate whether the issue has been reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues. The script first tries to create a `NearestNeighbors` object with a float `n_neighbors` and checks for a `TypeError`. If the error contains both 'float' and 'integer', it concludes the issue is reproduced. Then it checks that using an integer for initialization and a float in the `kneighbors` method does not raise an error, indicating the issue has been resolved.

from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

def test_neighbors_estimator():
    try:
        # Creating sample data
        X, y = make_blobs()

    except Exception as e:

test_neighbors_estimator()
```

### Explanation:
1. The test imports the necessary libraries (`NearestNeighbors` from `sklearn.neighbors` and `make_blobs` from `sklearn.datasets`).
2. The `test_neighbors_estimator` function is defined to reproduce the issue described.
3. A sample dataset is created using `make_blobs`.
4. An attempt is made to create an instance of `NearestNeighbors` with `n_neighbors` set to a float (3.0) and fit it to the dataset.
5. If a `TypeError` is raised due to the float value, the test will print `"Issue reproduced"`.
6. If no error or a different error is raised, it will print `"Other issues"`.
7. If the issue has been fixed and no error is raised, it will print `"Issue resolved"`.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue with the current implementation and verify after the fix has been applied.

```

This test follows the structure you provided and will help in reproducing the issue as well as verifying the fix. Here is a breakdown of the test:

1. **Imports**: The necessary modules are imported at the beginning.
2. **Code to Reproduce**: The test creates a dataset using `make_blobs`, initializes `NearestNeighbors` with a float `n_neighbors`, fits the data, and then calls `kneighbors`.
3. **Exception Handling**: The test captures the `TypeError` and checks its message to print "Issue reproduced" if the error message matches the expected issue. If any other exception or type of issue is encountered, it prints "Other issues".
4. **No Exception**: If no exception is raised, the test prints "Issue resolved".

You can run this test to see if the issue is reproduced or if it has been resolved after the necessary changes are made to the code.

This test will:
1. Attempt to reproduce the issue by using a float for `n_neighbors` during the initialization and while calling `kneighbors`.
2. Print "Issue reproduced" if the expected `TypeError` is raised.
3. Attempt to verify if the issue is resolved by using a float for `n_neighbors` during the `kneighbors` call.
4. Print "Issue resolved" if no error occurs during this verification step.
5. Print "Other issues" if a different error occurs.

2. Creates sample data using `make_blobs`.
3. Attempts to create a `NearestNeighbors` instance with a float `n_neighbors`, which should raise a `TypeError` if the issue is present.
4. Attempts to call the `kneighbors` method with a float `n_neighbors`, which also should raise a `TypeError` if the issue is present.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if no error is raised, "Issue reproduced" if the exact TypeError is encountered, and "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised.

To use this test:
1. Ensure you have `scikit-learn` installed in your Python environment.
2. Copy the script into a Python file, such as `test_neighbors.py`.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter, e.g., `python test_neighbors.py`.

Depending on the current state of the `scikit-learn` library:
- If the issue is reproduced, it will print "Issue reproduced".
- If the issue has been resolved, it will print "Issue resolved".
- If there are other issues, it will print "Other issues".

This test helps in both reproducing the issue and verifying if the issue has been fixed.

test_neighbors_estimator()

This test attempts to set the `n_neighbors` parameter as a float and then runs the `fit` and `kneighbors` methods to check if the issue is reproduced. Depending on the outcome, it prints appropriate messages to indicate whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

This test will:
1. Attempt to reproduce the issue by passing a float as `n_neighbors`.
2. Catch the specific `TypeError` that indicates the issue is present.
3. Attempt to verify that the issue has been resolved by checking if `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` works without raising an error.
4. Print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is confirmed.
5. Print "Issue resolved" if the issue has been fixed.
6. Print "Other issues" if any other unexpected errors occur.

This script includes:
1. Necessary imports from `sklearn`.
2. Code to reproduce the issue by using a float value for `n_neighbors`.
3. Condition to print "Issue reproduced" if the `TypeError` with the specific message occurs.
4. Condition to print "Other issues" if any other unexpected exceptions are raised.

This will allow you to verify if the issue is present or if it has been resolved once the necessary fix is applied.
