We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
ResolverMatch.__repr__() doesn't handle functools.partial() nicely.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Nick Pope)
	 
When a partial function is passed as the view, the __repr__ shows the func argument as functools.partial which isn't very helpful, especially as it doesn't reveal the underlying function or arguments provided.
Because a partial function also has arguments provided up front, we need to handle those specially so that they are accessible in __repr__.
ISTM that we can simply unwrap functools.partial objects in ResolverMatch.__init__().

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."

This test will help you verify if the `ResolverMatch.__repr__()` method handles `functools.partial` objects correctly. It creates a partial function, passes it to `ResolverMatch`, and checks if `__repr__` output contains `'functools.partial'`. If it does, the issue is reproduced; if not, the issue is resolved. Any other exceptions will be caught and printed as "Other issues."

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Import `functools` for creating a partial function and `ResolverMatch` from `django.urls`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Define a dummy view function, create a partial function using `functools.partial`, and initialize `ResolverMatch` with this partial function.
3. **Print statements**:
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if `repr` output indicates the issue where it shows `functools.partial` and doesn't reveal the underlying function.
   - Print "Issue resolved" if `repr` output shows the underlying function instead of `functools.partial`.
   - Print "Other issues" if none of the above conditions are met.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: `functools` and `ResolverMatch` from `django.urls`.
2. **Function Definition (`view_function`)**: A sample function to be used with `functools.partial`.
3. **Partial Function Creation (`partial_view`)**: Creates a partial function by pre-filling `arg1` with `'value1'`.
4. **ResolverMatch Creation (`match`)**: A `ResolverMatch` instance is created using the partial function.
5. **Repr Output Check**: Checks if the `__repr__` output of `ResolverMatch` correctly displays the underlying function and its arguments.
6. **Conditional Statements**: Depending on the presence of the function and argument in the `__repr__` output, prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues".

This test should be run within the context of a Django project where `ResolverMatch` is available. It helps determine whether the issue with `functools.partial` handling in the `__repr__` of `ResolverMatch` is reproduced or resolved.

3. A sample view function `sample_view` is defined.
4. The test function `test_resolver_match_with_partial`:
   - Creates a partial function.
   - Creates an instance of `ResolverMatch` with the partial function.
   - Checks the `__repr__` output to see if it contains `functools.partial`.
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the issue is found, "Issue resolved" if it's fixed, or "Other issues" if any other exception occurs.

Here is a breakdown of what the test does:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Defines a sample view function to be wrapped using `functools.partial`.
3. Creates a partial function from the sample view function.
4. Creates an instance of `ResolverMatch`, passing the partial function as the view.
5. Gets the `repr` string of the `ResolverMatch` instance.
6. Checks if the `repr` string contains `functools.partial`.
7. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the issue is detected, "Issue resolved" if the issue is fixed, and "Other issues" if there are other problems.

You can run this test to check whether the issue is present and to verify if it has been resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports the necessary modules and functions (`functools` and `ResolverMatch`).
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - A dummy view function `dummy_view` is defined.
   - A `functools.partial` object `partial_view` is created using `dummy_view` and a pre-set argument `param1=1`.
   - A `ResolverMatch` object `resolver_match` is instantiated with the partial view.
   - The `__repr__` of the `ResolverMatch` object is obtained.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If the `__repr__` contains the string `'functools.partial'`, the issue is reproduced and "Issue reproduced" is printed.
   - If the `__repr__` correctly includes the `dummy_view` function and its arguments, the issue is resolved and "Issue resolved" is printed.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "Other issues."

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_resolver_match_with_partial()
```

Explanation of the test:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import the `functools` module to create a partial function.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: We define a `ResolverMatch` class with an `__init__` method that accepts a function and stores it. The `__repr__` method of this class is supposed to return a string representation of the function passed.
3. **Partial function**: We create a partial function using `functools.partial`, providing a predefined argument.
4. **Test function**: We define a test function `test_resolver_match_with_partial` that creates an instance of `ResolverMatch` with the partial function and then prints the `__repr__` output.
5. **Outcome checks**: By checking if "functools.partial" is in the `__repr__` output, we determine if the issue is reproduced or resolved. If an exception occurs, we print "Other issues" along with the exception details.

To verify the issue has been fixed, you would need to modify the `__repr__` method of the `ResolverMatch` class to properly handle `functools.partial` and return a more informative string representation.

### Explanation
1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - `functools` is imported to create a partial function.
   - `ResolverMatch` is imported from `django.urls`.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A simple view function (`sample_view`) is defined.
   - A `functools.partial` object (`partial_view`) is created from `sample_view`, pre-filling `arg1` and `arg2`.
   - A `ResolverMatch` object is created using `partial_view`.
   - The `__repr__` method of the `ResolverMatch` object is called to get its string representation.
   
3. **Outcome Check**:
   - If the `repr` output contains `functools.partial`, it indicates that the issue is reproduced.
   - If the `repr` output shows the underlying function and arguments, it indicates that the issue is resolved.
   - Any other output will print "Other issues".

This test setup should help in verifying if the described issue with `functools.partial` in `ResolverMatch.__repr__` is present or has been resolved.

3. **Test Function**: In the test function `test_resolver_match_repr_with_partial`, we:
   - Create a `ResolverMatch` instance with the partial function.
   - Capture the `__repr__` output of the `ResolverMatch` instance.
   - Check if the `__repr__` output contains `'functools.partial'` to determine if the issue is reproduced.
   - Check if the `__repr__` output contains details about the underlying `simple_view` function and its arguments to determine if the issue is resolved.
   - Print "Other issues" if unexpected outcomes or exceptions occur.

  - Initializes a `ResolverMatch` instance with `partial_view`.
  - Gets the `__repr__` string of the `ResolverMatch` instance.
  - Checks if the `__repr__` contains 'functools.partial' but not the underlying function name 'test_view':
    - If true, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If false, it prints "Issue resolved".
  - Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" if any occur.

This test checks if the `__repr__` method of `ResolverMatch` correctly handles `functools.partial` objects by displaying the underlying function and its arguments. When running the test, it should print "Issue reproduced" if the issue exists, "Issue resolved" if the problem has been fixed, or "Other issues" if there are other problems with the source code.

test_resolver_match_with_partial()
```
Explanation:
1. Necessary imports: `import functools`
2. The `ResolverMatch` class is created to mimic the functionality described in the issue.
3. In the `__repr__` method, it checks if `self.func` is an instance of `functools.partial` and unwraps it to show the underlying function, arguments, and keywords.
4. The `test_resolver_match_with_partial` function is used to create a partial function and pass it to `ResolverMatch`.
5. The `repr_output` is then checked to ensure it contains the expected strings.
6. Depending on the outcome, it prints "Issue resolved", "Issue reproduced", or "Other issues".

This test should reproduce the issue if the `__repr__` method doesn't handle `functools.partial` correctly and confirm it is resolved if the `__repr__` method is updated as shown.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The `functools` module is imported to create a partial function.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A simple `original_function` is defined that takes two arguments.
   - A partial function `partial_func` is created using `functools.partial` with one of the arguments fixed.
   - A `ResolverMatch` object is created with the partial function.
   - The `__repr__` method of the `ResolverMatch` object is called to see how it represents the partial function.

3. **Print Statements**:
   - The `repr_output` is checked to see if it contains "functools.partial", indicating the issue is reproduced.
   - If the `repr_output` includes details about the original function and its arguments, the issue is resolved.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "Other issues".

This test should help in both reproducing the original issue and verifying if a fix resolves the problem as intended.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports the `functools` module, which is necessary to create partial functions.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Defines a `ResolverMatch` class with an `__init__` method that accepts a function and a `__repr__` method that returns a string representation of the instance.
   - Defines a test function `test_resolvermatch_repr_with_partial` that:
     - Creates a sample function `sample_function`.
     - Creates a partial function using `functools.partial`.
     - Creates a `ResolverMatch` instance using this partial function.
     - Checks the string representation (`__repr__`) of the `ResolverMatch` instance.
3. **Outcome Checks**:
   - If the string representation contains "sample_function", it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the string representation contains "functools.partial", it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be used to reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been resolved correctly.

        print("Issue resolved")
    else:

test_resolvermatch_partial_repr()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports `partial` from `functools` and `ResolverMatch` from `django.urls`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The test creates a `partial` function from `dummy_view` and uses it as the `func` argument in `ResolverMatch`.
3. **Check Repr Output**: The `__repr__` method of `ResolverMatch` is called, and the output is checked to see if it contains the unwrapped details of the `partial` function.
4. **Conditional Prints**: Based on the repr output, the test prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues". 

This test should help identify if the issue with `ResolverMatch.__repr__()` handling `functools.partial` is still present or has been resolved.

test_resolvermatch_repr_with_partial()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary imports are provided from `functools` and `django.urls`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - A sample view is defined as `sample_view`.
   - A partial view is defined as `partial_view` with one argument.
   - A partial function of `partial_view` is created using `functools.partial`.
   - A `ResolverMatch` object is created with the partial function.
   - The `__repr__` of the `ResolverMatch` object is checked to see if it properly shows the underlying function and the provided arguments.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If the `__repr__` output contains the underlying function name and arguments, "Issue resolved" is printed.
   - Otherwise, "Issue reproduced" is printed.
4. **Exception handling**:
   - Any exceptions will print "Other issues" along with the exception message to help diagnose other potential issues.

This test script checks whether the issue described in the issue text (regarding the representation of `functools.partial` in `ResolverMatch.__repr__`) is resolved or still present.
