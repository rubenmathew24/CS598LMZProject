--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Display fixture scope with `pytest --fixtures`
It would be useful to show fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`; currently the only way to learn the scope of a fixture is look at the docs (when that is documented) or at the source code.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The `subprocess` module is imported to run the `pytest` command with the `--fixtures` flag.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The script runs `pytest --fixtures` and captures the output.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If the output contains fixture scopes (i.e., `scope=`), it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the output does not contain fixture scopes, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any exception occurs during the process, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

You can run this script to check if the issue with `pytest --fixtures` not displaying fixture scopes is reproduced or resolved.

In this test:

1. We define four pytest fixtures with different scopes (`session`, `module`, `class`, `function`).
2. We run the `pytest --fixtures` command programmatically and capture its output.
3. We check whether the scopes of the fixtures are displayed in the output.
4. We print "Issue resolved" if the scopes are correctly shown, "Issue reproduced" if they are not, and "Other issues" if there are other problems not directly related to the fixture scopes.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been resolved.

This test script performs the following tasks:

1. Imports necessary modules (`pytest` and `subprocess`).
2. Defines a sample fixture with a specific scope (`session`).
3. Writes the fixture to a temporary file (`test_fixture.py`).
4. Runs pytest with the `--fixtures` option and captures the output.
5. Checks if the output contains both the fixture name and its scope.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if the fixture scope is displayed.
7. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the fixture scope is not displayed.
8. Prints "Other issues" if there are any other issues with the source code or pytest run.
9. Cleans up by removing the temporary file after the test run.

You can run this script to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved based on the output of `pytest --fixtures`.

Sure, here's a detailed test script designed to reproduce and verify the issue described in the issue text. This script checks if `pytest --fixtures` displays fixture scopes, and it will print the appropriate messages depending on whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if other issues are encountered.

# Run the test
test_fixture_scope_display()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `subprocess` to run the pytest command and capture its output. It also imports `pytest` to define the fixtures.
2. **Fixtures Definition**: Four fixtures with different scopes (`session`, `module`, `class`, and `function`) are defined to simulate the scenario.
3. **Test Function**: The `test_fixture_scope_display` function runs `pytest --fixtures` and captures its output.
4. **Output Analysis**: The function checks if the output includes the fixtures and their scopes. If all the fixtures and their scopes are correctly displayed, it prints "Issue resolved". If the scopes are not displayed, it prints "Issue reproduced". If any other issues are encountered, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.
5. **Run the Test**: The `test_fixture_scope_display` function is called to execute the test.

By using this script, you can verify if the fixture scopes are displayed properly with the `pytest --fixtures` command and determine if the issue has been resolved.
2025-05-03 14:21:42,630 - INFO - raw output:
Certainly! Below is a complete test script to reproduce and verify the issue regarding displaying fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`.

```python
import pytest
import subprocess

def test_fixture_scope_display():
    try:
        # Run pytest with --fixtures option and capture the output
        result = subprocess.run(["pytest", "--fixtures"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        output = result.stdout

        # Check if any fixture scopes are displayed in output
        if "scope" in output:
            print("Issue resolved")
        else:
            print("Issue reproduced")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(str(e))

    return

test_fixture_scope_display()
```

This test will execute `pytest --fixtures` and then analyze the output to check if the fixture scopes are displayed. Depending on whether the scopes are found in the output, it will print the appropriate message indicating if the issue is reproduced or resolved. If there are other issues, such as an error in running the command, it will print "Other issues" and provide details of the exception encountered. 

Make sure to have `pytest` installed and available in your environment to use this test script effectively.

2. Runs `pytest --fixtures` to list all fixtures.
3. Checks if the output includes the fixture names along with their respective scopes.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the scopes are displayed correctly.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the scopes are not displayed.
6. Prints "Other issues" if there is any other unexpected problem during the check.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We have imported `pytest` to define fixtures and use `pytest.main()` to run `pytest --fixtures`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test defines fixtures with different scopes (`function`, `module`, `session`, and `class`). It then runs `pytest --fixtures` to list all the fixtures and their details.
3. **Print based on the outcome**:
   - If the scopes of the fixtures are correctly displayed, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the scopes are not displayed, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If there is any other issue, it catches the exception and prints "Other issues".

This test helps you identify if the `pytest --fixtures` command shows the fixture scopes as expected. If it doesn't, the issue is reproduced. If it does, the issue has been resolved.

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        return

test_display_fixture_scope_with_pytest_fixtures()
```

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules (`pytest` and `subprocess`).
2. Runs `pytest --fixtures` to capture its output.
3. Checks if the output contains the fixture scope information by looking for the term "scope: ".
4. Prints `"Issue resolved"` if the scope information is present.
5. Prints `"Issue reproduced"` if the scope information is not present.
6. Prints `"Other issues"` if there is an exception while running the subprocess command.

You can run this test to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

In this test script:
1. **Necessary imports**: The `pytest` module is imported.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Example fixtures with different scopes are defined. The test then runs `pytest` with the `--fixtures` option and captures the output.
3. **Print statements**: Depending on whether the fixture scopes are displayed or not, the test prints "Issue resolved" or "Issue reproduced". If there are other issues, it prints "Other issues".

The test can be used to verify if the issue of displaying fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures` has been resolved.

### Explanation
1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - `subprocess` is imported to run the `pytest --fixtures` command and capture its output.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - We use `subprocess.run` to execute the `pytest --fixtures` command and capture the output.
   - We then check whether the output contains the word 'scope', which would indicate that fixture scopes are being displayed.

3. **Print Statements**:
   - `"Issue reproduced"` is printed if 'scope' is not found in the output, indicating the issue is still present.
   - `"Issue resolved"` is printed if 'scope' is found in the output, indicating the issue has been resolved.
   - `"Other issues"` is printed if there is an exception or any other issue encountered during the test execution.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been fixed.

```

This script tests whether fixture scopes are displayed when using the `pytest --fixtures` command. The test defines a sample fixture with a module scope, captures the output of the `pytest --fixtures` command, and checks if the scope information is included in the output. It prints "Issue resolved" if the scope is displayed, "Issue reproduced" if the scope is not displayed (indicating the issue is still present), and "Other issues" if there are any other discrepancies.

3. It checks if the output contains the names of the defined fixtures.
4. It further checks if the output includes the scopes of these fixtures.
5. Based on the output, it will print "Issue resolved" if the scopes are displayed correctly, "Issue reproduced" if the scopes are not displayed, and "Other issues" if the fixtures themselves are not listed or if an exception occurs.

    - We redirect the standard output to capture the output of the `pytest --fixtures` command.
    - We check if the output contains the word "scope" which would indicate that fixture scopes are being displayed.
3. **Outcome handling**:
    - If "scope" is found in the output, it means the issue is resolved and we print "Issue resolved".
    - If "scope" is not found in the output, it means the issue is reproduced and we print "Issue reproduced".
    - Any other exceptions are caught and we print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

```

This test script creates several fixtures with different scopes (function, module, session, and class) and then runs `pytest --fixtures` while capturing its output. It checks if the output contains the word "scope" to determine if the fixture scope information is displayed. If the scope information is not displayed, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the scope information is displayed, it prints "Issue resolved". If there is any other issue while running the test, it will print "Other issues" along with the error message.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The imports include `pytest`, `StringIO` (to capture output), and `sys`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The function `test_fixture_scope_display` runs `pytest` with the `--fixtures` option and captures the output.
3. **Print appropriate messages**:
   - If the output does not contain 'scope', which is our check to see if fixture scope is displayed, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If 'scope' is found in the output, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If there are other issues (e.g., exceptions), it prints "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports `pytest` and necessary internal modules to list the fixtures and their scopes.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test defines three sample fixtures with different scopes: `function`, `module`, and `session`.
3. **Print statements for outcomes**: The test lists the fixtures and checks if their scopes are correctly identified. It prints "Issue resolved" if it correctly identifies all scopes, "Issue reproduced" if it does not, and "Other issues" if any other exception occurs.
4. **Test execution**: The test function `test_fixture_scope_display` is called to run the test.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Necessary imports include `pytest` and standard libraries for running subprocesses and regular expressions.
2. **Fixtures**: Defined fixtures with various scopes (session, module, class, function) to test the scope display.
3. **Test Function**:
   - Runs the `pytest --fixtures` command and captures its output.
   - Defines expected scopes for each fixture.
   - Uses a regular expression to check if each fixture's scope is displayed correctly in the output.
   - If any fixture's scope is not displayed correctly, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If all fixtures' scopes are displayed correctly, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Handles any subprocess errors and prints "Other issues" if there are underlying problems with running the command.

This test can be used to check if the fixture scopes are displayed correctly when using `pytest --fixtures`.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Only the `subprocess` module is imported as we need to run the `pytest` command.
2. **Reproduce the issue**: The test function runs `pytest` with the `--fixtures` flag using `subprocess.run`. It captures the output of the command.
3. **Check the output**: The output is checked for the presence of scope indicators (`function`, `class`, `module`, `session`). 
4. **Print statements**: Depending on whether the scopes are found in the output, it prints `Issue reproduced` or `Issue resolved`. If any exception occurs, it prints `Other issues` along with the exception message.

This test can be used to verify if the issue with displaying fixture scopes using `pytest --fixtures` has been resolved or not.

In this test:
1. Two fixtures are defined with different scopes (`function` and `module`).
2. The `test_fixture_scope_display` function runs `pytest --fixtures` and captures the output.
3. The output is checked to see if it includes information about the fixture scopes.
4. The appropriate message is printed based on whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

This test should be placed in your test suite, and running it will help determine whether the fixture scope is displayed correctly by `pytest --fixtures`.

2025-05-03 14:21:42,631 - INFO - raw output:
Certainly! Below is a complete test script to reproduce and verify the issue described in the issue text:

```python
import pytest
import subprocess

def test_fixture_scope_display():
    # Define a sample fixture with a specific scope
    @pytest.fixture(scope='module')
    def sample_fixture():
        return "sample fixture"

    # Run pytest with the --fixtures option and capture the output
    result = subprocess.run(['pytest', '--fixtures'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

    # Check if the fixture scope is displayed in the output
    if 'sample_fixture' in result.stdout and 'module' in result.stdout:
        print("Issue resolved")
    elif 'sample_fixture' in result.stdout:
        print("Issue reproduced")
    else:
        print("Other issues")

test_fixture_scope_display()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: We import `pytest` and `subprocess`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - We define a sample fixture with a specific scope (`module`).
    - We run `pytest` with the `--fixtures` option using `subprocess.run` to capture the command output.
3. **Outcome Checks**:
    - If the fixture name (`sample_fixture`) and its scope (`module`) appear in the output, we print "Issue resolved".
    - If only the fixture name appears without the scope, we print "Issue reproduced".
    - If neither appear or an error occurs, we print "Other issues".

This test will help determine if the fixture scope is displayed correctly with the `pytest --fixtures` command.
