--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()
Description
	
As pointed out by ​Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports the necessary modules, including `logging` and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A signal `test_signal` is defined.
   - A receiver function `faulty_receiver` is defined, which raises a `ValueError`.
   - The receiver is connected to the signal.
   - The signal is sent using `send_robust`, which should handle the exception.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the exception message "This is a test exception" is found in the responses, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the exception message is not found, it prints "Other issues".
   - If no exceptions are found, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test can be used to verify if the issue described in the issue text is reproduced or resolved.

   - `test_signal_send_robust()` sends the signal using `send_robust`.
   - It checks the responses for exceptions.
   - If an exception is found, it logs the exception and prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If no exceptions are found, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any other unexpected issue occurs, it logs the exception and prints "Other issues".

This test will help in reproducing the issue where exceptions in signal receivers are not logged and can be used to verify if the issue is resolved by logging exceptions in `Signal.send_robust()`.

This test does the following:

1. Imports necessary components (`logging` and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`).
2. Defines a custom signal `test_signal` and a receiver `faulty_receiver` that raises an exception.
3. Connects the `faulty_receiver` to the `test_signal`.
4. Sets up logging to capture and verify log messages.
5. Sends the signal using `send_robust` and checks if the exception message is logged.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if the exception is logged, "Issue reproduced" if it is not, and "Other issues" if there are other problems.

This test can be used to verify both the presence and the fixing of the logging behavior in `Signal.send_robust()`.

In this test:

1. Necessary imports are provided.
2. A custom signal (`test_signal`) is created.
3. A receiver (`faulty_receiver`) is connected to the signal, which raises an exception when the signal is sent.
4. The logger is configured to capture log entries.
5. The signal is sent using `send_robust()`.
6. The test checks if the exception message "Something went wrong in the receiver!" is present in the logger output.

If the exception is logged, the script prints "Issue resolved". If the exception is not logged, it prints "Issue reproduced". If any other issue occurs, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:**
   - Import `logging` for capturing logs.
   - Import `Signal` from `django.dispatch` to create a signal.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue:**
   - Set up a logger to capture log outputs.
   - Define a test signal using `Signal()`.
   - Define a faulty receiver function `faulty_receiver` that intentionally raises an exception.
   - Connect the faulty receiver to the signal.
   - Send the signal using `send_robust` to test if the exception is logged.
   
3. **Outcome checks:**
   - If the exception message "An error occurred in receiver" is found in the logged output, print "Issue resolved".
   - If the exception message is not found, print "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other unexpected issue occurs, print "Other issues".

The test checks if the exception raised in the receiver is properly logged by `Signal.send_robust()`. If the fix is implemented correctly, the logger should capture and log the exception, verifying that the issue is resolved.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import required modules such as `logging` and `Signal`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - **Logging setup**: We set up logging to capture and print exception messages.
   - **Signal and receiver setup**: We define a `Signal` and a receiver function `faulty_receiver` that raises an exception.
   - **Connect receiver**: Connect the receiver to the signal.
3. **Test function**:
   - We use `send_robust` to send the signal and handle exceptions.
   - If there are exceptions, they are logged and the message "Issue reproduced" is printed.
   - If no exceptions are found, the message "Issue resolved" is printed.
   - Any other unexpected issues are caught and "Other issues" is printed.

Explanation:
1. We import the necessary modules and set up logging to capture any log messages.
2. We define a signal named `test_signal`.
3. We define a receiver function `faulty_receiver` that raises a `ValueError`.
4. We connect `faulty_receiver` to `test_signal`.
5. We define the test function `test_signal_send_robust_exception_logging` which sends the signal using the `send_robust` method and captures any exceptions.
6. The test function prints "Issue resolved" if no exceptions are encountered, "Issue reproduced" if the specific exception is raised, and "Other issues" for any other unexpected exceptions.
7. We run the test function if the script is executed directly.

```

Explanation:
1. The `logging` module is imported to handle logging.
2. The `Signal` class is imported from `django.dispatch`.
3. A logger is created and configured to log at the `INFO` level.
4. A signal named `test_signal` is defined.
5. A receiver function `faulty_receiver` is defined, which raises a `ValueError` when called.
6. The receiver is connected to the signal.
7. The `test_signal_send_robust` function is defined to test the behavior of `send_robust`.
   
   - It sends the signal using `send_robust`.
   - It checks if the exception raised by the receiver is caught and handled.
   - It prints "Issue resolved" if the exception is handled as expected.
   - It prints "Other issues" if unexpected exceptions are raised.
   - It prints "Issue reproduced" if no exceptions are raised, indicating that the issue described in the issue text is present.

The provided test can be used to verify the issue is reproduced as well as to check if the issue has been resolved once a fix is applied.

2. Define a custom signal.
3. Connect a receiver to the signal that raises an exception.
4. Send the signal using `send_robust`.
5. Check the logs to verify if the exception is logged.

Here's the complete test code to achieve this:

    # Ensure the logger writes to a file
    handler = logging.FileHandler('logfile.log')
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    
    test_signal_send_robust_logging()
```

Explanation:
1. **Custom Signal and Receiver**: We define a custom signal and attach a receiver that raises an exception.
2. **Logging Configuration**: We configure logging to capture log output in a file named `logfile.log`.
3. **Test Function**: The test function sends the custom signal using `send_robust`, checks the responses for exceptions, and then checks if the exception message is present in the log file.
4. **Outcome Printing**: Depending on whether the exception is logged, it prints "Issue resolved" or "Issue reproduced". If other issues are encountered, it prints "Other issues".

Run this script in the context of a Django project to reproduce the issue and verify if it has been resolved.

Here is a complete test that can be used to reproduce and verify the issue described in the issue text:

```python
import logging
from django.dispatch import Signal

# Initialize logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Define a custom signal
my_signal = Signal()

# Define a receiver function that raises an exception
def faulty_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    raise ValueError("An error occurred in the receiver")

# Connect the receiver to the signal
my_signal.connect(faulty_receiver)

def test_signal_send_robust():
    try:
        # Send the signal using send_robust()
        responses = my_signal.send_robust(sender=None)
        # Extract exceptions from responses
        exceptions = [response[1] for response in responses if isinstance(response[1], Exception)]

        if exceptions:
            # If there are exceptions, check if they are logged
            try:
                with open('errors.log', 'r') as f:
                    log_content = f.read()
                if any("An error occurred in the receiver" in log_content for e in exceptions):
                    print("Issue resolved")
                else:
                    print("Issue reproduced")
            except FileNotFoundError:
                print("Issue reproduced")
        else:
            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

# Ensure the logger logs to a file
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('errors.log')
file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

test_signal_send_robust()

# Clean up log file after the test
import os
os.remove('errors.log')
```

This test does the following:

1. It sets up logging and defines a custom signal and a faulty receiver function that raises an exception.
2. It connects the receiver to the signal.
3. The `test_signal_send_robust` function sends the signal using `send_robust()` and checks if exceptions are logged.
4. If exceptions are found, it attempts to read the log file and checks for the specific error message. If the message is not found, it indicates that the issue is reproduced. If the message is found, it indicates the issue is resolved.
5. If no exceptions are found or other issues occur, it prints "Other issues."
6. It ensures that logs are written to a file for checking.

Make sure to run this test in an environment where Django is properly configured. The `errors.log` file will be used to check if the exception logging is working as expected, and it will be cleaned up after the test.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports**:
   - `logging` for logging the exceptions.
   - `Signal` from `django.dispatch` to create and use the signal.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - A logger is set up to capture and log exceptions.
   - A `Signal` instance is created.
   - A faulty receiver function (`faulty_receiver`) is defined which intentionally raises an exception.
   - The receiver is connected to the signal.
   - The signal is sent using the `send_robust()` method, which captures exceptions raised by the receivers.

3. **Outcome checks**:
   - The code checks the responses from the `send_robust()` call.
   - If an exception is found in the responses, it logs the exception and prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If no exception is found, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any unexpected issue in the `try` block is caught, logged, and prints "Other issues".

This test will help in verifying if the exceptions raised in the signal receivers are being logged as expected, reproducing the issue if the logging is missing, and confirming the resolution if the logging is present.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import the required modules, `logging` for logging and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - We set up a logging configuration to capture and display logs.
    - We create a `Signal` instance called `test_signal`.
    - We define a `faulty_receiver` function that raises a `ValueError` to simulate an exception.
    - We connect the `faulty_receiver` to the `test_signal`.
3. **Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced**: If an exception occurs in the signal receiver, we log the exception and print "Issue reproduced".
4. **Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved**: If no exceptions are found in the signal results, we print "Issue resolved".
5. **Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code**: If an unexpected error occurs during the test execution, we log the error and print "Other issues".

This test script will help to identify if the issue described in the issue text has been reproduced or resolved, or if there are other issues in the source code.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The script imports necessary modules, `logging` for logging configuration and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`.
2. **Logging Configuration**: It sets up basic logging configuration to capture the logs.
3. **Signal and Receiver**: It defines a signal `test_signal` and a faulty receiver that raises an exception.
4. **Test Function**: The `test_signal_send_robust()` function:
    - Connects the faulty receiver to the signal.
    - Sends the signal using `send_robust()`.
    - Inspects the responses to check if the exception was raised and handled.
    - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the exception is found in the responses.
    - Prints "Other issues" for any unexpected behaviors.
    - Prints "Issue resolved" if no exceptions are found in the responses.

This script allows you to see if the exceptions in `send_robust()` are correctly logged or not, helping you verify both the existence and resolution of the issue.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary modules (`logging` and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`) are imported.
2. **Logger Setup**: A logger is set up to capture logging output. This ensures that if `logger.exception()` is called within `Signal.send_robust()`, it will be captured.
3. **Signal and Receiver**: A custom signal `test_signal` and a receiver `faulty_receiver` are created. The receiver raises an exception to simulate the issue.
4. **Test Function**: The `test_signal_send_robust_logging` function is defined to:
    - Send the signal using `send_robust()`, which should trigger the exception in `faulty_receiver`.
    - Check if the exception message is logged.
    - Print appropriate outcomes based on whether the issue is reproduced or resolved.
5. **Run the Test**: The test function is called to execute the test.

This test will print "Issue reproduced" if the exception raised by `faulty_receiver` is not logged, indicating that the issue still exists. If the exception is logged, it will print "Issue resolved". If any other issues occur, it will print "Other issues".

Explanation:

1. We import the necessary modules including `logging` and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`.
2. We set up the logging configuration.
3. We define a custom signal `test_signal`.
4. We create a receiver function `faulty_receiver` that intentionally raises a `ValueError`.
5. We connect this faulty receiver to `test_signal`.
6. We define a test function, `test_signal_send_robust`, which sends the signal robustly using `Signal.send_robust()`.
7. After sending the signal, we check the responses to see if the exception has been logged. Depending on the outcome, the function prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. The test imports necessary modules, including `logging` and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`.
2. It configures the logger to print debug messages to the console.
3. A custom signal (`my_signal`) is defined, and a receiver function (`faulty_receiver`) that raises a `ValueError` is connected to this signal.
4. The `test_signal_send_robust_logging` function is designed to send the signal using `send_robust` and check whether the exception from the receiver is properly logged.
5. The function prints "Issue reproduced" if the exception is caught and identified, indicating the issue is present. Otherwise, it prints "Issue resolved."
6. If any other exception occurs during the test, it prints "Other issues" and exits.

### Explanation
1. **Imports**: The necessary modules (`logging` and `django.dispatch.Signal`) are imported.
2. **Logging Setup**: Logging is set up to capture exception logs.
3. **Signal and Receiver Setup**: A signal is created and a receiver function is defined that raises an exception.

5. **Test Function**: The `test_signal_send_robust` function sends the signal using `send_robust` and checks if the exception is logged.
6. **Outcome Detection**:
   - If the exception is found in the logs, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the exception is not found in the logs, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating the issue is still present.
   - If any other exceptions occur, it prints "Other issues".

### Note
This script assumes that logging is set up in a way that logs to a stream that can be read back (like `sys.stderr`). Adjustments might be needed for different logging configurations. The core idea is to check for the presence of the exception message in the logs.

In the provided test:

1. We set up a logger to capture and display log messages.
2. We define a signal and connect it to a faulty receiver that raises a `ValueError`.
3. We define a test function `test_signal_send_robust_logging()` which sends the signal using the `send_robust()` method.
4. If the exception is logged and correctly identified, it prints "Issue reproduced".
5. If the exception message is different or another exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
6. If no exception is raised (indicating the issue is resolved), it prints "Issue resolved".

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The required modules are imported.
2. **Logger Setup**: A logger is set up to capture the logs.
3. **Signal and Receiver Definition**: A Django signal is defined along with a faulty receiver that raises an exception.
4. **Receiver Connection**: The faulty receiver is connected to the signal.
5. **Test Function**: 
   - `test_signal_send_robust_logging` function simulates the issue by calling `send_robust` on the signal.
   - It checks the responses for exceptions and asserts their type and message.
   - It prints "Issue reproduced" if the exception is encountered and logged as expected.
   - It catches any other unexpected issues and prints "Other issues".
   - If assertions pass, it prints "Issue resolved".

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Creating a custom signal
test_signal = Signal()

        logger.exception("An unexpected exception occurred")
        print("Other issues")
        return

test_signal_send_robust()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports:**
   - `logging` for configuring the logger.
   - `Signal` from `django.dispatch` to work with Django signals.

2. **Setup Logger:**
   - Configuring the logger to capture debug level messages.

3. **Create Signal and Faulty Receiver:**
   - Define a signal named `test_signal`.
   - Define a faulty receiver function `faulty_receiver` that raises an exception.

4. **Connect Receiver:**
   - Connect the `faulty_receiver` to the `test_signal`.

5. **Test Function:**
   - Use `send_robust` to send the signal. This method catches exceptions in the receivers and returns them in the response list.
   - Check the responses returned by `send_robust`. If any response is an exception, print "Issue reproduced".
   - If no exceptions are encountered, print "Issue resolved".
   - Any unexpected exceptions that occur outside the signal sending and handling will be logged and print "Other issues".

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been fixed.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports the `logging` module and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - A logger is set up to capture log messages.
    - A sample signal (`sample_signal`) is defined.
    - A receiver function (`faulty_receiver`) is defined, which raises a `ValueError`.
    - The faulty receiver is connected to the signal.
3. **Test Logic**:
    - The `test_signal_send_robust_logging` function sends the signal using `send_robust`.
    - It checks the results to see if any exceptions were caught.
    - If exceptions were caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If no exceptions were caught, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If any unexpected exceptions occur during the test, it prints "Other issues" and logs the exception.
4. **Outcome Indications**:
    - "Issue reproduced" is printed if the test successfully reproduces the issue.
    - "Issue resolved" is printed if the issue has been fixed.
    - "Other issues" is printed if there are other unexpected issues in the source code.

This test is designed to verify whether exceptions raised in signal receivers are logged appropriately, as described in the issue text.
2025-05-03 14:06:34,578 - INFO - raw output:
Certainly! Below is a complete test to reproduce and verify the issue described with `Signal.send_robust()` in Django. This test will involve creating a signal, connecting a receiver that raises an exception, and then calling `Signal.send_robust()` to see if the exception is logged.

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Issue reproduced")  # Log file not created means logging didn't occur

test_signal_send_robust_logging()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports:** Imported necessary modules including `logging`, `Signal`, and `receiver`.
2. **Set Up Logging:** Configured logging to capture logs. Adjust this part to suit your logging setup.
3. **Define Signal and Receiver:** Created a custom signal and connected a receiver that raises an exception.
4. **Test Function:**
   - Called `send_robust` on the custom signal.
   - Checked for the presence of the exception message in the log file `django.log`.
   - Printed "Issue resolved" or "Issue reproduced" based on whether the exception message was logged.

### Notes:
- Ensure your Django settings are configured to write logs to `django.log`. Adjust the logging configuration if you use a different setup.
- This test assumes that the log file `django.log` is where Django logs its messages. If your logging configuration differs, you might need to adapt the file path and logging setup accordingly.

### Explanation
1. **Imports**: Import the necessary `logging` module and `Signal` from `django.dispatch`.
2. **Logger Setup**: Set up a logger to capture logging output.
3. **Signal Setup**: Define a custom signal and a receiver function `faulty_receiver` that raises an exception.
4. **Test Function**: Create a test function `test_signal_send_robust_logging` which:
    - Sends the signal using `send_robust()`.
    - Checks if the exception raised by the receiver is logged.
    - Prints "Issue resolved" if the exception message is found in log output.
    - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the exception message is not found in the log output.
    - Prints "Other issues" if some other unexpected issue occurs.

### Usage
1. **Reproduce the Issue**: Run this test before applying any fixes to see "Issue reproduced".
2. **Verify the Fix**: Modify the `send_robust()` method to include `logger.exception()` in the except clause. Then run this test again to see "Issue resolved".

This setup ensures that the test is self-contained and reflects the issue mentioned in the issue text.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We need to import the necessary modules from Django and the logging library.
2. **Setup Signal**: We define a custom signal `test_signal`.
3. **Logging Setup**: Configure logging to capture log messages for later verification.
4. **Faulty Receiver**: Create a signal receiver `faulty_receiver` that intentionally raises an exception.
5. **Test Function**: The function `test_send_robust_signal()`:
   - Clears existing logger handlers and sets up a new handler to capture log outputs.
   - Sends the signal using `send_robust()`.
   - Checks if an exception is raised in the signal responses.
   - Retrieves and examines the captured log output to determine if the exception message is logged.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if the exception is logged, "Issue reproduced" if it is not logged, and "Other issues" if other errors occur.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary imports for `logging`, `Signal`, and `StringIO` to capture log messages.
2. **Setup**: Defines a signal and connects a receiver that raises a `ValueError`.
3. **Test Function**: The `test_signal_send_robust_logging` function:
   - Sets up a `StringIO` stream to capture log messages.
   - Attaches a `StreamHandler` to the logger.
   - Sends the signal using `send_robust` and captures the responses.
   - Checks the captured log messages to verify if the `ValueError` was logged.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if the log contains the expected exception message, otherwise prints "Issue reproduced".
   - Handles any unexpected exceptions by printing "Other issues".
   - Finally, cleans up the logger handlers.

The test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been fixed by checking the log messages.

Here is the complete test to reproduce the issue described in the issue text:

```python
import logging
from django.dispatch import Signal

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Define a test signal
test_signal = Signal()

# Define a receiver function that will raise an exception
def faulty_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    raise ValueError("This is a test exception")

# Connect the faulty receiver to the test signal
test_signal.connect(faulty_receiver)

# Function to test if the issue is reproduced
def test_signal_send_robust_exception_logging():
    try:
        # Send the signal robustly
        responses = test_signal.send_robust(sender=None)
        # Check if exceptions were logged
        exceptions = [response[1] for response in responses if isinstance(response[1], Exception)]
        if exceptions:
            # Check the log output (this would need a custom log handler to capture in real tests)
            print("Issue reproduced")
        else:
            print("Issue resolved")
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any unexpected issues
        print("Other issues")
        logger.exception(e)

# Run the test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_signal_send_robust_exception_logging()
```

This test attempts to reproduce the issue by:
1. Defining and configuring a logger.
2. Creating a test signal and a faulty receiver function that raises an exception.
3. Connecting the faulty receiver to the test signal.
4. Sending the signal robustly and checking if the exceptions are handled and logged.

If the exceptions are logged as expected, it will print "Issue reproduced". If the exceptions are not logged, it will print "Issue resolved". If there are any other unexpected issues, it will print "Other issues".

```

In this test:
1. We define a custom logging handler to capture log messages.
2. We create a signal and a receiver function that raises an exception.
3. We connect the receiver to the signal and send the signal using `send_robust`.
4. We check if the exception raised by the receiver function is logged.
5. The test prints "Issue resolved" if the exception is logged, "Issue reproduced" if it is not, and "Other issues" if an unexpected exception is raised during the test.
