regression in input validation of clustering metrics
```python
from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score
import numpy as np

x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
mutual_info_score(x, x)

ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'b'

while
```python

works with a warning?

this worked in 0.21.1 without a warning (as I think it should)


Edit by @ogrisel: I removed the `.astype(object)` in the second code snippet.

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"

test_mutual_info_score_regression()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** The script imports `mutual_info_score` from `sklearn.metrics.cluster` and `numpy` as `np`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** The test initializes an array `x` with random choices from `['a', 'b']` and then attempts to apply `mutual_info_score` on it:
   - The first attempt uses `x.astype(object)`, which is expected to reproduce the issue.
   - The second attempt uses `x` directly without `.astype(object)`, which should work with a warning.
3. **Print Statements for Outcomes:**
   - "Issue reproduced" if the specific `ValueError` is raised.
   - "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised.
   - "Other issues" if any unexpected exceptions occur.

This test script should be able to reproduce the issue, verify if it exists, and determine if the issue has been resolved in the package.

Certainly! Below is the complete test script designed to reproduce the issue described in the issue text. It checks the behavior of the `mutual_info_score` function from `sklearn.metrics.cluster` with different data types.

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(e)

test_mutual_info_score_input_validation()
```

This script performs the following steps:
1. Imports the necessary modules.
2. Defines a function `test_mutual_info_score_input_validation` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Tries to reproduce the issue with the first code snippet by creating an array with `astype(object)` and calling `mutual_info_score`.
4. Handles the `ValueError` to check if it matches the specific error message related to converting strings to floats.
5. Checks the behavior with the second code snippet that does not use `astype(object)`.
6. Prints appropriate messages based on the results to indicate whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

To run the test, simply execute the script in an environment where `sklearn` and `numpy` are installed.

Here is a complete test script based on the provided issue text. This test will help determine if the issue with the `mutual_info_score` function in the `sklearn.metrics.cluster` module has been reproduced or resolved.

```

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import the necessary modules, `mutual_info_score` and `numpy`.
2. **Test Function**: Define `test_clustering_metrics_issue` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. **Reproduce Issue**:
    - Generate an array `x_object` with `dtype=object` and call `mutual_info_score`. If a `ValueError` with the specific message is raised, print "Issue reproduced" and return.
4. **Check for Resolution**:
    - Generate an array `x_no_object` without `dtype=object` and call `mutual_info_score`. If no exceptions are raised, print "Issue resolved".
5. **Handle Other Issues**: If any unexpected exceptions are raised, print "Other issues".

This script will help identify if the issue persists, has been resolved, or if there are other underlying issues.

```

This test script:
1. Imports the necessary modules (`mutual_info_score` from `sklearn.metrics.cluster` and `numpy`).
2. Defines a function `test_clustering_metrics_input_validation` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Attempts to reproduce the issue by creating an array of objects (`x`) and passing it to `mutual_info_score`.
4. Catches and checks for the specific `ValueError` to determine if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if other issues are present.
5. Prints the appropriate message based on the outcome of the test.

You can run this script to verify whether the issue described in the issue text is reproduced or if it has been resolved.

This test script does the following:
1. It attempts to reproduce the issue with the code snippet provided in the issue text.
2. It catches the `ValueError` and checks if the error message matches the expected message indicating the issue.
3. If the error occurs and matches the expected message, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If no error occurs, it proceeds to verify if the warning behavior matches the expected behavior of a resolved issue.
5. If everything passes without issues, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. Any other exceptions or discrepancies will result in "Other issues" being printed, along with the exception message if applicable.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** The imports required for the test are `mutual_info_score` from `sklearn.metrics.cluster` and `numpy` as `np`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** The code exactly replicates the scenario described in the issue text. It generates an array with random choices between 'a' and 'b', converts them to `object` type, and then passes them to `mutual_info_score`.
3. **Print Statements:** Based on the outcome, the code prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific `ValueError` is raised, "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised, and "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

```python

import numpy as np

def test_regression_in_input_validation_of_clustering_metrics():
    try:

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

test_regression_in_input_validation_of_clustering_metrics()
```

Here's a breakdown of what the test does:
1. **Necessary Imports**: Import necessary modules `mutual_info_score` from `sklearn.metrics.cluster` and `numpy`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: Create an array `x` with random choices 'a' and 'b', convert it to an object type, and then call `mutual_info_score(x, x)`.
3. **Outcome Handling**: 
   - If a `ValueError` is raised with the message indicating the string-to-float conversion error, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Check Resolution**: Attempt the same operation again to verify if it works without any exceptions, printing "Issue resolved" if successful.

Run the provided test script to determine whether the issue is still present or has been resolved.

This test script follows the required steps:
1. Imports the necessary modules.
2. Creates a scenario to reproduce the issue.
3. Checks for specific exceptions to determine if the issue has been reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

Run the test to see the output and determine the current state of the issue.

```

This test script will:
1. Import the necessary modules.
2. Attempt to reproduce the issue as described by using the `.astype(object)` conversion on the array.
3. Check if the raised `ValueError` matches the expected issue.
4. Attempt to run the `mutual_info_score` function without the `.astype(object)` conversion to verify if the issue is resolved.
5. Print appropriate messages based on the outcome.

```

This test script follows the steps to reproduce the issue:
1. It imports the necessary libraries.
2. It defines a test function to reproduce the issue described in the issue text.
3. It attempts to cause the `ValueError` by running `mutual_info_score` on a numpy array with the `dtype` set to `object`.
4. If the specific `ValueError` is caught, it prints `"Issue reproduced"`.
5. It then checks if the issue is resolved by running the same function on a numpy array without `.astype(object)`, suppressing any warnings, and prints `"Issue resolved"` if no exceptions occur.
6. If any other exceptions are encountered, it prints `"Other issues"`. 

You can run this script to verify the behavior and to ensure that the issue has been fixed.
