--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings
The comparison with assertion rewriting for byte strings is confusing: 
```
    def test_b():
>       assert b"" == b"42"
E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'42'
E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 52
E         Full diff:
E         - b''
E         + b'42'
E         ?   ++
```

52 is the ASCII ordinal of "4" here.

It became clear to me when using another example:

```
    def test_b():
>       assert b"" == b"1"
E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'1'
E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 49
E         Full diff:
E         - b''

2. Defines a function `test_confusing_assertion_rewriting()` which includes:

   - Error handling to check if the error message contains the expected confusing part and prints "Issue reproduced" if it does.
   - Another sub-test `test_b()` to reproduce the issue where `assert b"" == b"1"` is tested.
   - Similar error handling to check if the error message contains the expected confusing part and prints "Issue reproduced" if it does.
3. Calls `test_confusing_assertion_rewriting()` to execute the test.

This script will print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is still present, "Issue resolved" if the asserts pass (which they shouldn't in this context), or "Other issues" if a different error occurs.

test_assertion_rewriting_with_byte_strings()
```

Explanation:
1. The code defines a test function `test_assertion_rewriting_with_byte_strings`.
2. Inside this function, another function `test_b` is defined, which has the problematic assertion `assert b"" == b"42"`.
3. The `test_b` function is called inside a try-except block.
4. If an `AssertionError` is raised, the error message is checked to see if it contains the specific details described in the issue text ("first extra item: 52" and "Right contains more items").
5. If these details are found in the error message, the issue is considered reproduced and "Issue reproduced" is printed.
6. If other issues are detected (i.e., the error message does not contain the expected details), "Other issues" is printed.
7. If no exception is raised, "Issue resolved" is printed, indicating that the issue has been fixed.

This test can be used to verify if the issue described in the issue text is present in the code or has been resolved.

```

This test script:
1. Defines a function `test_b` that raises an `AssertionError` when comparing two byte strings.
2. Uses `pytest` to check the raised `AssertionError` message to determine if the issue is reproduced.
3. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific confusing message is present.
4. Prints "Other issues" if any other exception is raised or the message is different.
5. Attempts to check if a fixed version of the code resolves the issue (the `test_b_fixed` function), and prints "Issue resolved" if the assert statement no longer produces the confusing message.

In this test:
1. We define two functions `test_b1` and `test_b2` that will intentionally raise `AssertionError` due to the byte string mismatches.
2. We use `pytest.raises` to confirm that the exceptions are raised and to capture the error messages.
3. We then check if the specific numbers "52" and "49" (ASCII ordinals of "4" and "1", respectively) appear in the error messages as described in the issue.
4. According to the outcome, it will print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is correctly identified, "Issue resolved" if the assertions pass (indicating the issue might be fixed), or "Other issues" if another type of exception is raised.

3. If the issue is reproduced, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If the behavior indicates that the issue has been fixed, it prints "Issue resolved".
5. If any other unexpected behavior or exceptions occur, it prints "Other issues".

You can run this script in your environment to verify the behavior and confirm if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

# Run the test function
test_byte_string_assertion_issue()
```

Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The necessary `pytest` import is included.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The function `test_b` is defined to reproduce the issue, where `assert b"" == b"42"` is the specific assertion causing the issue.
3. **Verification**: The test checks if the `AssertionError` contains the substring `"52"` and `"first extra item"` in its output, which indicates the issue is reproduced.
4. **Outcome Printing**: It catches exceptions and prints "Issue reproduced" if the outcome matches the initial confusion, "Issue resolved" if the assertion is no longer confusing, and "Other issues" if an unexpected error occurs. 

You can run this test function to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

This test script defines a function `test_b()` that contains the assertion which reproduces the issue. The script then tries to run this function and catches the `AssertionError`. It checks if the error message contains specific substrings that indicate the issue described in the issue text. If those substrings are found, it prints "Issue reproduced". If different substrings are found, indicating that other issues might be present, it prints "Other issues". If no error is raised, implying the issue has been fixed, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test function will catch the `AssertionError` and check if the specific confusing message with ASCII ordinal "52" and byte string representations are in the error message. If they are, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the `AssertionError` does not contain the expected message, it prints "Other issues". If no `AssertionError` is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test script will:
1. Import pytest.
2. Define two functions (`test_a` and `test_b`) to reproduce the issue described in the issue text.
3. Use `pytest.raises` to catch the `AssertionError` and check the exception message to determine if the issue is reproduced.
4. Print "Issue reproduced" if the specific messages indicating the issue are found.
5. Print "Other issues" if different issues are encountered during execution.
6. Print "Issue resolved" if the specific messages are not found.

The test should be run in an environment where pytest is available. The output will indicate whether the issue has been reproduced or if there are other issues.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The `pytest` module is imported since it might be necessary for handling assertions and related functionalities.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The `test_b` function performs an assertion that is expected to fail based on the issue description.
3. **Outcome handling**:
    - If an `AssertionError` is raised, the error message is checked for specific content that matches the reported issue.
    - If the specific content is found, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If the content does not match, it prints "Other issues".
    - If no `AssertionError` is raised at all, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test should help in both reproducing the issue as described and verifying if the issue has been resolved once changes are made.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import pytest, necessary for raising and catching `AssertionError`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Defined a test function `test_b` that asserts `b"" == b"42"`, which will fail.
3. **Outcome validation**:
    - `pytest.raises` is used to catch the `AssertionError`.
    - We check whether the expected confusing parts of the error message are present.
4. **Print appropriate messages**:
    - "Issue reproduced" if the confusing message parts are present.
    - "Issue resolved" if they are not present.
    - "Other issues" if any other exception occurs during the test.

This test should help in reproducing the issue and also in verifying if the issue has been fixed.
