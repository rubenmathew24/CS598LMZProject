--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
urllib3 exceptions passing through requests API
I don't know if it's a design goal of requests to hide urllib3's exceptions and wrap them around requests.exceptions types.

(If it's not IMHO it should be, but that's another discussion)

If it is, I have at least two of them passing through that I have to catch in addition to requests' exceptions. They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)

Thanks!


--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."
        assert result[1]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'NVL'."
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:

Make sure you have `requests` installed. You can install it using:

```sh
pip install requests
```

This test attempts to make a request to a non-routable IP address with a very short timeout to trigger a TimeoutError. The expected behavior is to catch `requests.exceptions.Timeout`. If instead, `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` or `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` are caught, it means the issue is reproduced. If `requests.exceptions.Timeout` is correctly caught, it means the issue is resolved. Any other exceptions will prompt "Other issues".

Explanation:
- The test function `test_urllib3_exceptions_passing_through_requests` aims to reproduce the scenario where `urllib3` exceptions pass through the `requests` API.
- The function tests for two specific exceptions: `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.
- The `decode_error_url` and `proxy_timeout_url` are hypothetical URLs designed to trigger the specific exceptions.
- The test checks if these exceptions occur and prints "Issue reproduced" if either of the exceptions is raised, indicating that the issue is present.
- It also prints "Issue resolved" if neither exception is raised, indicating that the exceptions are properly handled or wrapped by the `requests` API.
- An additional check is performed to ensure that there are no other unexpected issues, printing "Other issues" if any unexpected exceptions occur.

This test can be used to verify whether the issue described in the provided issue text has been fixed in the codebase.

This test script will attempt to reproduce the specified issue by making use of intentional errors that should trigger `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` exceptions. If these exceptions are caught, it prints "Issue reproduced". If a general `RequestException` from the `requests` library is caught instead, it prints "Issue resolved". Any other exceptions will print "Other issues".

This test script sets up a scenario where a request through a non-existent proxy simulates a timeout to check for `TimeoutError`. Additionally, another scenario could be constructed to simulate a `DecodeError`, but for simplicity and to ensure we focus on one aspect, the provided example is based on the timeout situation. 

To fully test for `DecodeError`, you would need to simulate a response that is improperly encoded or corrupted, which is more complex and often requires a mock server setup. However, this script should cover the essence of checking whether `urllib3` exceptions are directly passed through or not.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: We import the required modules including `requests`, `RequestException`, `DecodeError`, and `TimeoutError`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Simulate a `DecodeError` by creating a `requests.Response` object with invalid content and attempting to parse it as JSON.
   - Simulate a `TimeoutError` by trying to make a request to an invalid IP with a very short timeout.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If `DecodeError` or `TimeoutError` is caught, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
   - If `RequestException` is caught, it indicates the issue is resolved (as requests exceptions should wrap these).
   - Any other exceptions indicate other issues.

This test should help in reproducing the issue and verifying if it has been resolved.

In this test, we are trying to reproduce the issue where `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3` are not wrapped within `requests.exceptions`. We:

1. Import necessary modules and exceptions.
2. Create a test function to make a request to an invalid URL to trigger the desired exceptions.
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the `DecodeError` or `TimeoutError` exceptions are caught.
4. Print "Issue resolved" if a `RequestException` is caught, indicating that exceptions are properly wrapped.
5. Print "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

This test should help reproduce and verify the issue as described.

   - A GET request to `httpbin.org/deflate` to simulate a decode error.
3. **Print statements**:
   - Print `"Issue reproduced"` if an exception is of type `DecodeError` or `TimeoutError`.
   - Print `"Issue resolved"` if the exception is a `requests.exceptions.RequestException` but not a `DecodeError` or `TimeoutError`.
   - Print `"Other issues"` if any other exception is caught.

This test should help identify if the exceptions are being properly wrapped or not.

2. Next, we attempt to cause a `TimeoutError` by setting a proxy to a non-existent IP address and a short timeout.

The test checks if these specific exceptions from `urllib3` are caught, indicating the issue is reproduced. If any other `RequestException` is caught, it indicates there are other issues.

This test attempts to reproduce the issue by making a request to a URL that introduces a delay, with a very short timeout set to trigger a `TimeoutError`. It checks for the presence of `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3`, indicating that they are not being wrapped properly by `requests`. If such an exception is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced." If a `RequestException` is caught, it prints "Issue resolved," indicating that the exceptions are being correctly wrapped by `requests`. Any other unexpected exceptions would result in "Other issues" being printed.

test_urllib3_exceptions_passing_through_requests()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**:
   - The `requests` library.
   - Specific exceptions (`DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`) from `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions`.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A test function `test_urllib3_exceptions_passing_through_requests` is defined.
   - Within the function, an HTTP GET request is made to a specified URL. Adjust the URL to one that you know will trigger the exceptions or use a local server to force these errors.
   - The timeout is set to 1 second to force a `TimeoutError`.

3. **Handling the Exceptions**:
   - The code checks for `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` to see if they pass through the `requests` library directly.
   - If these exceptions are caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other `requests.exceptions.RequestException` is caught, it further checks if it's a `ProxyError` caused by a `TimeoutError`.

4. **Outcome Messages**:
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the expected exceptions are caught.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if no exceptions are caught, implying the issue is fixed.
   - Prints "Other issues" for any other exceptions or issues encountered.

Use this test script to verify if the issue with `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API is reproducible and whether it has been fixed. Adjust the URL and timeout settings to suit your specific testing environment.

Explanation:
1. We try to simulate a `DecodeError` by sending a request to an endpoint with an invalid compression response.
2. We simulate a `TimeoutError` by requesting a delay via a proxy that will cause a timeout.
3. If either `DecodeError` or `TimeoutError` from `urllib3` exceptions occur, the test prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If any other `RequestException` occurs, the test prints "Other issues".
5. If no exceptions occur, the test prints "Issue resolved".

This test should help in reproducing the described issue and verifying any fixes.

This test script has two primary sections:
1. The first section attempts to induce a `DecodeError` by requesting a gzip-encoded response and trying to decode it improperly.
2. The second section attempts to induce a `TimeoutError` by setting a proxy that will timeout.

If the exceptions are properly caught as `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` or `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`, the script will print "Issue reproduced". If the exceptions are handled correctly by the `requests` library and do not propagate as `urllib3` exceptions, the script will print "Issue resolved". If other issues arise, the script will print "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. The test imports the necessary modules, specifically `requests` and `RequestException`.
2. The function `test_urllib3_exceptions` attempts to reproduce both the `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` exceptions as mentioned in the issue text.
3. If either `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` or `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced" followed by the specific exception type.
4. If a `RequestException` is caught, it prints "Other issues".
5. If no exception is caught and the code executes successfully, it prints "Issue resolved".

By running this test, you can determine if the specified `urllib3` exceptions are being correctly wrapped or not.

1. Imports the necessary `requests` module and its exceptions.
2. Tries to simulate the `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` mentioned in the issue description.
3. Catches specific `urllib3` exceptions and prints "Issue reproduced" if they occur.
4. Catches more generic `requests` exceptions and prints "Issue resolved".
5. Catches any other exceptions and prints "Other issues".

By running this script, you can confirm whether the issue is still present or has been fixed.

In this test:
1. We try to simulate a `DecodeError` by making a request to a streaming endpoint.
2. We then simulate a `TimeoutError` by setting up a proxy with a non-routable IP address and a very short timeout.

If either `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` or `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` exceptions are raised, it will print `"Issue reproduced"`. If other exceptions specific to `requests` are caught, it will print `"Other issues"`. If none of these specific `urllib3` exceptions are raised, it will print `"Issue resolved"`.

test_urllib3_exceptions_passing_through_requests()
```

This test script tries to reproduce the issues mentioned in the issue text by triggering `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` using HTTP requests that might cause these specific exceptions. The exact URLs and conditions might need to be adjusted depending on the exact behavior of the `requests` and `urllib3` libraries in your current environment. The script will print "Issue reproduced" if the specific `urllib3` exceptions are not being properly caught and wrapped by `requests`, "Issue resolved" if they are, and "Other issues" for any other exceptions or issues encountered.
