We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
bell(n).limit(n, oo) should be oo rather than bell(oo)
`bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should take the value infinity, but the current output is `bell(oo)`. As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.

```
from sympy import *
n = symbols('n')
bell(n).limit(n,oo)

Output:
bell(oo)
```

I'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.


--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2

# Run the test
test_bell_limit_issue()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: 
   - `symbols`, `bell`, and `oo` are imported from Sympy to create the symbolic variable, use the Bell number function, and represent infinity, respectively.
   
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - We create a symbolic variable `n` using `symbols('n')`.
   - Compute the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity using `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`.

3. **Outcome handling**:
   - If the result is `bell(oo)`, it indicates the issue is reproduced, so we print "Issue reproduced".
   - If the result is `oo`, it indicates the issue has been resolved, so we print "Issue resolved".
   - If any other result is obtained, it indicates there are other issues, so we print "Other issues".
   - If an exception occurs, it is caught and "Other issues" along with the exception is printed.

You can run this script to check the current status of the issue in your Sympy repository. If the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` is corrected, the script will print "Issue resolved". Otherwise, it will print "Issue reproduced". If there's any unexpected behavior or an error, it will print "Other issues".

   - If an exception is raised, print "Other issues" and exit.
   - Check if the result is `oo`. If so, print "Issue resolved".
   - If the result is `bell(oo)`, print "Issue reproduced".
   - For any other result, print "Other issues".

Here is a breakdown of what this script does:

1. **Imports necessary functions and classes from SymPy**: It imports `symbols` and `bell` from the `sympy` module.
2. **Defines a function `test_bell_limit()`**: This function contains the code to test the limit of the Bell number sequence as \( n \) approaches infinity.
3. **Tries to compute the limit**: It attempts to compute the limit of `bell(n)` as \( n \) approaches infinity using the `limit` method.
4. **Checks the outcome and prints an appropriate message**:
   - If the result is `bell(oo)`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the result is `oo`, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If there is any other issue (like an exception), it prints "Other issues".

You can use this script to verify both the presence of the issue and whether the issue has been resolved after making changes to the SymPy library.

test_bell_number_limit_issue()
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary components from Sympy.
2. Reproduces the issue by calculating the limit of the Bell number function as \( n \) approaches infinity.
3. Compares the output to the expected values to determine if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

test_bell_limit_issue()
```

This test script is designed to reproduce the issue described. It performs the following steps:
1. Imports the necessary components from Sympy.
2. Defines a test function `test_bell_limit_issue()` that:
   - Defines the symbol `n`.
   - Computes the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity.
   - Checks if the result matches `bell(oo)`, `oo`, or some other unexpected result.
3. Calls the `test_bell_limit_issue()` function to run the test.

The outcome will indicate:
- "Issue reproduced" if the issue is observed (i.e., the result is `bell(oo)`).
- "Issue resolved" if the issue has been fixed (i.e., the result is `oo`).
- "Other issues" if the result is neither `bell(oo)` nor `oo` or if there is an unexpected exception.

In this script:

   - Defines the symbol `n`
   - Calculates the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity
   - Checks the result and prints:
     - "Issue reproduced" if the result is `bell(oo)`, indicating the issue is still present.
     - "Issue resolved" if the result is `oo`, indicating the issue has been fixed.
     - "Other issues" if the result is neither `bell(oo)` nor `oo`, indicating there may be other problems with the code.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The `symbols`, `bell`, and `oo` functions are imported from Sympy.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Defines a symbolic variable `n` and attempts to evaluate `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`.
3. **Print statements**:
   - "Issue reproduced" if the result is `bell(oo)`, indicating the bug is present.
   - "Issue resolved" if the result is `oo`, indicating the bug has been fixed.
   - "Other issues" if an exception occurs or the result is something unexpected.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify that the issue has been fixed.

2. **Issue Reproduction**:
    - **Setup**: The symbolic variable `n` is defined.
    - **Operation**: The limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity is computed.
    - **Evaluation**:
        - If the result is `bell(oo)`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
        - If the result is `oo`, it prints "Issue resolved".
        - For any other result, it prints "Other issues".
    - **Exception Handling**: If an exception is raised, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message for debugging.

Sure, here is a complete test to reproduce and verify the issue in Sympy regarding the limit of the Bell numbers.

```python
from sympy import symbols, bell, oo

def test_bell_limit_issue():
    n = symbols('n')
    result = bell(n).limit(n, oo)
    
    if result == bell(oo):
        print("Issue reproduced")
    elif result == oo:
        print("Issue resolved")
    else:
        print("Other issues")

test_bell_limit_issue()
```

This test script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary symbols and functions from Sympy.
2. Defines a function `test_bell_limit_issue` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Inside the function, it computes the limit of the Bell number as `n` approaches infinity.
4. Checks the result and prints "Issue reproduced" if the result is `bell(oo)`, which indicates the issue is still present.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the result is `oo`, indicating the issue has been successfully fixed.
6. Prints "Other issues" if the result is neither `bell(oo)` nor `oo`, suggesting there might be some other problems.

You can run this script to verify the status of the issue in your repository.
