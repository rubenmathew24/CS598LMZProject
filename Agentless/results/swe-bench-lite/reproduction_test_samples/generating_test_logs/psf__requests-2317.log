--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
method = builtin_str(method) problem
In requests/sessions.py is a command:

method = builtin_str(method)
Converts method from
b’GET’
to
"b'GET’"

Which is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method "b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.

I am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this "args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.

I'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.

Also, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.

A request is made using this malformed method, and if the status code is `404`, it prints "Issue reproduced".\n3. **Code to Verify the Fix:**\n    - The byte string method is correctly converted to a string using `.decode(\'ascii\')`.\n    - A request is made again using the corrected method, and if the status code is `200`, it prints "Issue resolved".\n4. **Error Handling:**\n    - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".\n\nThis test script will help to both reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been fixed correctly.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)), Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=10, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='```python\nimport requests\n\ndef test_method_conversion_issue():\n    try:\n        # Creating a mock session to test the issue\n        session = requests.Session()\n        \n        # Mock URL for testing purposes\n        url = \'http://httpbin.org/get\'  # This endpoint just echoes the request\n        \n        # Simulating the method being converted to a binary string\n        method = b\'GET\'\n        \n        # Simulating the conversion issue mentioned in the issue text\n        method = str(method)\n        \n        # Attempting to make a request using the session with the method converted\n        response = session.request(method=method, url=url)\n        \n        # Checking the response status code to determine if the issue is reproduced\n        if response.status_code == 404:\n            print("Issue reproduced")\n        else:\n            print("Issue resolved")\n    except Exception:\n        print("Other issues")\n\ntest_method_conversion_issue()\n```\n\nThis test script does the following:\n1.

Explanation:
1. We import `requests` and `builtin_str` from `requests.compat` to simulate the `builtin_str(method)` conversion.
2. We define a function `test_method_conversion_issue` to encapsulate the test.
3. We convert a binary string `b'GET'` to a string using `builtin_str`.
4. We create a `requests.Session` object to simulate making a request.
5. We use the `session.request()` method to make a GET request to `http://httpbin.org/get`, using the converted method string.
6. We check the response status code to determine if the issue is reproduced (404 Not Found) or resolved (any other status code).
7. We handle any potential exceptions from the `requests` library and print "Other issues" if they occur.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary modules (`requests` and `Session` from `requests.sessions`) are imported.
2. **Reproducing the Issue**:
    - A binary string `method_binary` is set to `b'GET'`.
    - A `Session` object is created.
    - The `method_binary` is converted to a string using `str` (to mimic the `builtin_str` behavior).
    - A request is attempted using the converted method.
3. **Outcome Checking**:
    - If the response status code is `404`, it concludes that the issue is reproduced.
    - Otherwise, it concludes that the issue is resolved.
4. **Exception Handling**:
    - Any exceptions during execution are caught, and "Other issues" is printed along with the exception message.

This test should be run in an environment similar to the one where the issue was observed to effectively reproduce and verify the issue.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** The necessary imports are for `requests` and `Session` from `requests.sessions`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Simulate the conversion of the method from bytes to string.
   - Create a `requests` session.
   - Use the incorrectly converted method string in a request.
3. **Print Statements:**
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if the response status code is 404.
   - Print "Issue resolved" if the issue does not occur.
   - Print "Other issues" if there's an exception or any other unforeseen issue.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: `requests` and `builtin_str` from `requests.utils` have been imported as required.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: 
    - The method string is set to the binary string `b'GET'`.
    - `builtin_str` is then used to convert this binary string into a literal string.
3. **Checking the outcome**:
    - A request is made using the `requests` library with the converted method string.
    - If the status code is `404`, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
    - If the request does not result in a `404` status code, it means the issue is resolved.
    - If there is any other exception, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception details. 

Wrapping this code in a test function like `test_method_conversion_issue` allows you to easily run it and check the outcome.

This test script performs the following:
1. Converts the method from a binary string to a literal string (simulating the problematic behavior).
2. Creates and sends a request using the `requests` library.
3. Checks if the response status code is `404`, indicating that the issue has been reproduced.
4. Catches exceptions and prints "Other issues" if any other issues occur.

Make sure to execute this test script in an isolated environment to avoid any unintended side effects.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** The necessary modules `requests` and `Session` are imported.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** 
    - A `mock_url` is defined to simulate the HTTP request.
    - A `Session` object is created.
    - The `method` is defined as a byte string (`b'GET'`).
    - The method is intentionally converted to a string using `str(method)`, which reproduces the issue by converting it to the literal string `"b'GET'"`.
    - A request is made using this malformed method, and if the status code is `404`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
3. **Code to Verify the Fix:**
    - The byte string method is correctly converted to a string using `.decode('ascii')`.
    - A request is made again using the corrected method, and if the status code is `200`, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. **Error Handling:**
    - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".

This test script will help to both reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been fixed correctly.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The script imports necessary modules, `requests` and `Session` from `requests.sessions`.
2. **Simulate the issue**: The script simulates the issue by converting a binary string method (`b'GET'`) to a literal string (`"b'GET'"`). 
3. **Perform the request**: The script performs an HTTP GET request using the converted method.
4. **Check status code**: It checks the response status code. If it's 404, the issue is reproduced. Otherwise, the issue is considered resolved.
5. **Exception Handling**: If any other issues arise, it will print "Other issues" followed by the exception message.

Copy the script into your environment and run it to test whether the issue is reproduced or resolved.

   - A `Session` object is instantiated.
   - The method `'GET'` is defined in binary format as `b'GET'`.
   - The binary method is then converted to a string using `str(binary_method)`.
   - The request is executed using the session's `request` method.
   - The response status code is checked. If it is 404, the issue is reproduced; otherwise, it is resolved.
4. Handles any exception and prints "Other issues" if encountered.
5. Calls the function to run the test.

Sure, here is a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue described in the issue text using the `requests` and `neutronclient` packages. 

```python

def test_requests_issue():
    try:
        # Simulate the conversion to binary string and back to string in Python 3.4+
        method = utils.safe_encode_list(['GET'])[0]

            print("Issue resolved")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues:", e)

test_requests_issue()
```

Explanation of the code:
1. **Necessary imports**:
   - `requests` for making HTTP requests.
   - `neutronclient.common.utils` to access `safe_encode_list` which simulates the conversion to binary string.
   
2. **Reproducing the issue**:
   - `utils.safe_encode_list(['GET'])[0]` converts the method 'GET' to a binary string `b'GET'`.
   - `builtin_str(method)` converts the binary string to the string `"b'GET'"`.
   - A request is made using this modified method, which should result in a 404 Not Found response if the issue is reproduced.

3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the response status code is 404 and the method used in the request is `"b'GET'"`, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
   - If the request is successful or the method is not `"b'GET'"`, it indicates the issue is resolved.
   - Any other exceptions are caught and "Other issues" is printed with the exception message.

This test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.

test_requests_method_conversion()
```

In this test:

1. The issue is reproduced by converting the byte string `b'GET'` directly to a string, resulting in `"b'GET'"`.
2. We make a request to a non-existent URL to get a 404 Not Found response.
3. It checks the response status code to determine if the issue is reproduced.
4. The issue is then attempted to be resolved by correctly decoding the byte string before making the request.
5. The test checks the response status code again to verify if the resolution is successful.

This test setup should help in both reproducing the issue and verifying the fix.

    # If the request succeeds without raising an exception, issue seems resolved
    if response and response.status_code == 200:

test_requests_method_handling()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Importing `requests` and `builtin_str` from `requests.compat`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The `mock_send_request` function simulates the conversion of a binary method to a string and then attempts to send a request using `requests.request`. 
3. **Checking for reproduction**: If an exception is thrown and the error message indicates the method issue, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. **Checking for resolution**: If the request succeeds (which it shouldn't if the issue is present), it prints "Issue resolved".
5. **Handling other issues**: If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".

This test should be capable of reproducing the issue as well as verifying if the issue has been fixed.

Sure, here is a comprehensive test that should help reproduce the issue described in the issue text, and also help verify if the issue has been fixed. 

```python
import requests

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        # Simulate the scenario described in the issue

        method = builtin_str(method)
        
        # Create a dummy request to reproduce the issue

        # Catch any other issues
        print("Other issues")
        print(e)

reproduce_issue()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**:
   ```python
   import requests
   from requests.utils import builtin_str
   ```
   We import `requests` for making HTTP requests and `builtin_str` to simulate the problematic conversion.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   ```python
   method = b'GET'
   method = builtin_str(method)
   ```
   This simulates the conversion from a binary string method to a literal string as described.

3. **Making a Request**:
   ```python
   response = requests.request(method, url)
   ```
   We make a request using the method and a sample URL (using `httpbin.org` which is a simple HTTP request & response service).

4. **Print Statements Based on Outcome**:
   ```python
   if response.status_code == 404:
       print("Issue reproduced")
   else:
       print("Issue resolved")
   ```
   We check the response status code to determine if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

5. **Handling Exceptions**:
   ```python
   except Exception as e:
       print("Other issues")
       print(e)
   ```
   This will print "Other issues" if there are other exceptions/problems not related to the described issue.

### How to Use:
- Run this test in an environment where you have the `requests` library installed.
- Observe the output to determine if the issue has been reproduced or resolved.

This test should effectively help you identify whether the issue persists and also check if the problem is resolved in future changes.

This test script will attempt to reproduce the issue described in the issue text by simulating the conversion of a binary string `method` to a literal string and then making an HTTP request with it. It then checks the response status code to determine if the issue has been reproduced or resolved, printing the appropriate message. If there are any unexpected exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: Imported the required `requests` module.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: 
   - Created a binary string `method = b'GET'`.
   - Converted it to a string using `str(method)` which should simulate the issue.
   - Made a GET request using the modified `method`.
3. **Print Statements**: 
   - If the response status code is 404, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the request is successful (i.e., it does not return 404), it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Prints "Other issues" along with the exception message if any other exception occurs, indicating other problems with the code.

This test should be able to reproduce the issue if it still exists, and verify if it has been resolved or if there are other underlying issues.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Creates an instance of the `Session` class from the `requests` library.
3. Defines a mock URL and sets the HTTP method to a binary string (`b'GET'`).
4. Simulates the issue by converting the binary string method to a regular string, which introduces the problem described.
5. Makes a request using the incorrectly converted method.
6. Checks the response status code to determine if the issue has been reproduced (404 Not Found indicates the issue is reproduced).
7. Catches any exceptions and prints detailed messages for other potential issues. 

You can run this script to verify the described issue and use it to test if the issue has been resolved in the future.

Explanation of the test:
1. **Imports**: The test imports the necessary modules for making HTTP requests and handling the conversion of the method string.
2. **Reproducing the Issue**:
   - The method is initially set to `b'GET'`, which is a binary string.
   - The method is then converted to a literal string using `builtin_str(method)`, which is what is causing the issue as per the provided issue text.
3. **Making the Request**:
   - A request is made to `https://httpbin.org/status/200` using the modified method.
   - If the issue is present, the method will be "b'GET'" and should result in a 404 Not Found response.
4. **Outcome Verification**:
   - If the response status code is 200, it indicates that the issue is resolved and prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the status code is not 200, it indicates that the issue is reproduced and prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exceptions occur during the test, it prints "Other issues".

3. **Print Statements**:
   - `print("Issue reproduced")` if a 404 Not Found response is received.
   - `print("Issue resolved")` if no exception occurs and no 404 status is returned.
   - `print("Other issues")` if any other exception is caught during execution.

2. **Utility Function**: `safe_encode_list` function is created to encode strings to binary, simulating the conversion that `python-neutronclient` does.
3. **Test Function**:
   - The method 'GET' is encoded to a binary string.
   - The encoded method is converted back to a string using `str()`, which leads to the issue described.
   - A request is made using the converted method.
   - The response is checked; if the status code is 404, the issue is reproduced. If not, the issue is resolved. Any exceptions will indicate other issues.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
   - `requests` library is imported as it is essential to reproduce the issue.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - A helper function `safe_encode_list` simulates the behavior of `neutronclient.utils.safe_encode_list`.
   - The `method` variable is encoded to a binary string.
   - The `method` variable is then converted back to a string using `str()`.
   - A request is made using the incorrect method string.
3. **Outcome Indicators**:
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the response status code is 404, indicating the issue is reproduced.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if the status code is not 404.
   - Prints "Other issues" if any exceptions occur during the process.

### Explanation
1. **Imports**: Necessary imports include `requests` to simulate making HTTP requests and `builtin_str` for method conversion, along with imports for creating a mock server.
2. **Mock Server**: A simple mock server is set up using Python’s `http.server` module to handle `GET` requests. This allows the test to be self-contained.
3. **Test Setup**: The URL for the mock server is defined and the method is initially a binary string (`b'GET'`).
4. **Method Conversion**: The method is converted using `builtin_str`.
5. **Request Execution**: The request is made using the converted method. The response code is checked to determine if the issue is reproduced.
6. **Outcome**: Based on the response status code, the output is printed to indicate whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if other issues are present.
7. **Cleanup**: The mock server is shut down cleanly at the end of the test.

This test should accurately reproduce the issue and provide a framework for verifying whether it has been resolved.

3. Sets up a dummy URL for testing (`http://httpbin.org/get`).
4. Creates a session using `requests.Session()`.
5. Defines the method as a binary string (`b'GET'`) and converts it to a string using `builtin_str`.
6. Sets up headers for the request.
7. Sends the request using the converted method.

    - "Issue reproduced" if the status code is 404 (indicating the issue).
    - "Issue resolved" if the status code is not 404 (indicating the issue is resolved).
    - "Other issues" if there is any exception.
4. **Test execution:** The `test_requests_with_binary_method` function is defined and executed to reproduce the issue.

You can run this test to check if the issue described is reproducible or if it has been resolved.

test_requests_issue()
```

This test script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary `requests` module and the `builtin_str` utility.
2. Sets up a test URL for making an HTTP request.
3. Simulates the `neutronclient` behavior by converting the HTTP method to a binary string (`b'GET'`).
4. Converts the binary string back to a string using `builtin_str`, mimicking the behavior in `requests/sessions.py`.
5. Attempts to make a request using the potentially malformed method string.
6. Checks the response status code to determine if the issue is reproduced or resolved.
7. Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" if there's an unexpected behavior.

The `httpbin.org` endpoint is used for safe testing of HTTP requests. This script should help you identify if the problem described in the issue is present and whether it has been fixed.

This test will:
1. Convert the method `b'GET'` to `"b'GET'"` using `builtin_str`.
2. Send a request using the converted method to `https://httpbin.org/get`.
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the server returns a 404 Not Found status, indicating the issue described.
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the server returns any other status code, indicating the issue has been addressed.
5. Print "Other issues" if an exception occurs during the request, indicating there may be other issues in the code.

This test will help you determine whether the conversion of the method from a binary string to a string literal is causing the problem as described in the issue text.

def test_builtin_str_method_issue():
    # Define a URL that will always be reachable for testing purposes
    url = 'https://httpbin.org/get'
    
    # Simulate the behavior by converting the method to a binary string and then back to a string
    method = b'GET'
    method = str(method)

    # Create a session

    request = requests.Request(method, url)
    prepped = session.prepare_request(request)
    
    # Try to send the request
    try:
        response = session.send(prepped)
        if response.status_code == 404:
            print("Issue reproduced")

            print("Issue resolved")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_builtin_str_method_issue()
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules.
2. Defines a function `test_builtin_str_method_issue` that:
   - Uses a reachable URL for testing.
   - Simulates the behavior described in the issue by converting the method to a binary string and then back to a string.
   - Creates a requests session and prepares a request.
   - Sends the request and checks the response status code.
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the status code is 404.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if the status code is not 404.
   - Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" with the exception message.

This script should help you reproduce and verify the issue described in the issue text.

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(e)

test_method_conversion_issue()
```

This test should be able to reproduce the issue described, specifically converting the method from a binary string to a native string and then attempting to use it in a request. The expected outcome is a 404 status code indicating that the issue is reproduced. If the issue has been fixed or no longer exists, it should print "Issue resolved." If there's an exception or any other issue, it will print "Other issues" and the exception message.
