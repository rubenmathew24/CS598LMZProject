--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Traceback printed for unrecognized option
### Bug description

A traceback is printed when an unrecognized option is passed to pylint.

### Configuration

_No response_

### Command used

```shell
pylint -Q
```


### Pylint output

```shell
************* Module Command line
Command line:1:0: E0015: Unrecognized option found: Q (unrecognized-option)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/markbyrne/venv310/bin/pylint", line 33, in <module>
    sys.exit(load_entry_point('pylint', 'console_scripts', 'pylint')())
  File "/Users/markbyrne/programming/pylint/pylint/__init__.py", line 24, in run_pylint
    PylintRun(argv or sys.argv[1:])
  File "/Users/markbyrne/programming/pylint/pylint/lint/run.py", line 135, in __init__
    args = _config_initialization(
  File "/Users/markbyrne/programming/pylint/pylint/config/config_initialization.py", line 85, in _config_initialization
    raise _UnrecognizedOptionError(options=unrecognized_options)
pylint.config.exceptions._UnrecognizedOptionError
```


### Expected behavior

The top part of the current output is handy:
`Command line:1:0: E0015: Unrecognized option found: Q (unrecognized-option)`

The traceback I don't think is expected & not user-friendly.
A usage tip, for example:
```python
mypy -Q
usage: mypy [-h] [-v] [-V] [more options; see below]
            [-m MODULE] [-p PACKAGE] [-c PROGRAM_TEXT] [files ...]
mypy: error: unrecognized arguments: -Q
```

### Pylint version

```shell
pylint 2.14.0-dev0
astroid 2.11.3
Python 3.10.0b2 (v3.10.0b2:317314165a, May 31 2021, 10:02:22) [Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)]

test_pylint_unrecognized_option_issue()
```

Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports:**
   - `subprocess`: This is used to run shell commands from within the Python script.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue:**
   - The `subprocess.run` function is used to execute the `pylint -Q` command, which is expected to produce the issue described.
   - The `capture_output=True` parameter captures both `stdout` and `stderr` outputs.
   - The `text=True` parameter ensures that the outputs are in string format for easier manipulation.

3. **Outcome checking:**
   - If the result contains "Unrecognized option found: Q" but also contains a "Traceback", it indicates the issue is reproduced, so it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the result contains "Unrecognized option found: Q" but does not contain a "Traceback", it indicates the issue has been resolved, so it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If neither of these conditions are met, it prints "Other issues".

This test allows you to check if the issue where a traceback is printed for an unrecognized option in Pylint has been fixed or still persists, and it handles other unexpected issues gracefully by catching exceptions and checking the output strings.

Explanation:
1. The script uses `subprocess.run` to execute the `pylint -Q` command to reproduce the issue.
2. The `capture_output=True` and `text=True` arguments are used to capture and read the output as text.
3. The output is checked for the presence of the expected error message `E0015: Unrecognized option found: Q (unrecognized-option)`.
4. If the "Traceback" text is found in the output, it confirms the issue is reproduced.
5. If the error message is there but without a "Traceback", it suggests the issue is resolved.
6. If neither condition is met, it prints "Other issues".
7. Any exceptions during execution are caught and printed as "Other issues".

This test will allow you to verify if the unrecognized option issue has been fixed in future versions of pylint.

### Explanation
1. **Imports**: The `subprocess` module is imported to run the `pylint` command and capture its output.
2. **Command Execution**: The `pylint -Q` command is executed using `subprocess.run`, with `capture_output=True` to capture both stdout and stderr, and `text=True` to get the output as a string.
3. **Output Handling**:
   - The script checks if the output contains "Unrecognized option found: Q".
   - If it does, it further checks for the presence of a traceback.
   - Based on these checks, it prints "Issue reproduced" if the traceback is present, "Issue resolved" if only the unrecognized option message is present without a traceback, and "Other issues" if neither condition is met.
4. **Exception Handling**: Any exceptions raised during the execution are caught and "Other issues" is printed, along with the exception message.

This test script will help determine whether the issue has been resolved or if it still persists by analyzing the output of running `pylint -Q`.

test_unrecognized_option_traceback()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Imports:** 
   - The `subprocess` module is used to run the `pylint` command with an unrecognized option and capture its output.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `test_unrecognized_option_traceback()` is defined to encapsulate the test logic.

3. **Run `pylint` with Unrecognized Option:**
   - The `subprocess.run` function is used to run `pylint -Q`, capturing both stdout and stderr output. The `text=True` argument ensures that the output is captured as a string.

4. **Check for Expected Output:**
   - First, it checks if the `stderr` contains the expected message for an unrecognized option.
   - If the unrecognized option message is found, it further checks if a traceback is present in the output. If so, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the unrecognized option message is found but no traceback is present, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "Other issues".

5. **Exception Handling:**
   - If any exception occurs during the execution of the test, it catches it and prints "Other issues".

```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports:**
   - `subprocess`: Used to run the `pylint` command with an unrecognized option and capture the output.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - The script runs `pylint -Q` using `subprocess.run()` and captures the stderr output where the traceback and error messages are usually printed.

3. **Outcome Based Printing:**
   - If the output contains a `Traceback`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the output contains the expected error message without a traceback, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "Other issues".

Ensure that this script is run in an environment where the same version of `pylint` and dependencies, as described in the issue text, are installed. This will help in accurately reproducing the issue.

```

This test script performs the following steps:
1. Imports the necessary `subprocess` module.
2. Defines a function `test_pylint_unrecognized_option` that:
   - Runs pylint with an unrecognized option `-Q`.
   - Captures the output and checks for the presence of the expected message regarding the unrecognized option.
   - Checks for the presence of a traceback in the standard error output to determine if the issue is reproduced or resolved.
3. Calls the defined function to execute the test.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import `subprocess` to run the pylint command.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Use `subprocess.run` to run `pylint` with the unrecognized option `-Q`.
3. **Check for Expected Output**: Capture the output and look for the specific error message and the presence of the traceback.
4. **Determine Outcome**: Print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is observed (i.e., traceback is present), "Issue resolved" if the issue is fixed and only the unrecognized option message appears, and "Other issues" if neither condition is met or if an exception occurs.
5. **Run the Test**: Call the function `test_pylint_unrecognized_option_issue` to execute the test.

This test allows you to verify both the reproduction of the issue and its resolution after applying any fixes.

test_pylint_unrecognized_option()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The necessary import is `subprocess` to run shell commands from within Python.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The `subprocess.run` function runs the `pylint -Q` command, capturing the output.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the stderr output contains "Unrecognized option found: Q", it means the unrecognized option was detected.
   - If it also contains "Traceback (most recent call last):", the issue with the traceback is reproduced.
   - If the traceback is not present, the issue is resolved.
   - If neither condition is met, it indicates other issues with the source code or the testing procedure.
4. **Print Statements**:
   - "Issue reproduced" if both conditions (unrecognized option and traceback) are met.
   - "Issue resolved" if only the unrecognized option is detected without a traceback.
   - "Other issues" if neither condition is met or if an exception occurs during the test execution.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules, including `Run` from `pylint.lint` and `_UnrecognizedOptionError` from `pylint.config.exceptions`.
2. Redirects `stderr` to capture the output generated by the `pylint` run.
3. Runs `pylint` with the unrecognized option `-Q`.
4. Checks if the captured output contains the expected error message indicating the unrecognized option.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the expected message is found in the output, "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised, and "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised or the output does not match expectations.
6. Restores the original `stderr`.

This test can be used to reproduce the issue described in the provided issue text and verify if the issue has been resolved.

3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If the expected error message `E0015: Unrecognized option found: Q (unrecognized-option)` is found in `result.stdout`, we proceed to check if there is a traceback in `result.stderr`.
   - If both the error message and the traceback are found, the issue is reproduced.
   - If the error message is found but no traceback, the issue is resolved.
   - If the expected error message is not found, it means there are other issues.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The `subprocess` module is imported to run the `pylint` command.
2. **Test Function**: The function `test_pylint_unrecognized_option_issue`:
   - Runs the `pylint -Q` command, capturing both the output (`stdout`) and error (`stderr`).
   - Checks if the expected error message about the unrecognized option is in the `stdout`.
   - Checks if the traceback is present in the `stderr`.
   - Prints `"Issue reproduced"` if the traceback is present, otherwise prints `"Issue resolved"`.
   - Catches any exceptions that occur during the execution and prints them as `"Other issues"`.

This test setup will help verify if the issue still exists or if it has been resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: I've imported the required `Run` method from `pylint.lint` and the `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exception class.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The main logic attempts to run `pylint` with an unrecognized option `-Q`.
3. **Handling Output**:
    - If `_UnrecognizedOptionError` is raised, it means the issue has been resolved, as `pylint` should now handle unrecognized options gracefully.
    - If `SystemExit` is raised with code other than 2 or if stderr output does not match the unrecognized option error, it indicates other issues.
    - If `SystemExit` is raised with code 2 and stderr output contains 'unrecognized-option', it indicates the issue is reproduced.
4. **Print Statements**: Based on the outcome, the appropriate message is printed.

Make sure to redirect `sys.stderr` to capture the output messages from `pylint` if required in a real test environment. This test case assumes the environment where stderr can be captured to check the specific output message.

1. **Necessary Imports:**
   - `subprocess`: To run the pylint command in a subprocess and capture its output.
   - `sys`: To get the Python executable path.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - The `subprocess.run` function is used to run the pylint command with the `-Q` option, which is not recognized by pylint.

3. **Print Statements:**
   - If the output contains the expected unrecognized option error message and a traceback, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the unrecognized option error message is present but no traceback is found, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the output does not contain the expected error message, it prints "Other issues".

This test script should be used to verify if the issue related to the unrecognized option's traceback has been reproduced or resolved after potential fixes.

This test script will:
1. Import the necessary `subprocess` and `sys` modules.
2. Run `pylint` with an unrecognized option `-Q` to reproduce the issue.
3. Capture the output and check if the specific error message about the unrecognized option `Q` is present.
4. Print "Issue reproduced" if the traceback is present in the stderr, indicating the issue is still there.
5. Print "Issue resolved" if the traceback is not present, indicating the issue is fixed.
6. Print "Other issues" if the specified error message is not found, indicating there may be other issues.

Explanation:
1. The script uses the `subprocess` module to run the `pylint -Q` command.
2. The output and error are captured using `capture_output=True` and `text=True`.
3. The script checks for the presence of the expected error message (`E0015: Unrecognized option found: Q (unrecognized-option)`) in the stdout.
4. If a traceback is present in stderr alongside the expected error message, it prints "Issue reproduced".
5. If the expected error message is found without a traceback, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. Any other issues during subprocess execution will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

# Run the test function
test_pylint_unrecognized_option()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import `subprocess` for running shell commands and `sys` to get the Python executable path.
2. **Function**: The function `test_pylint_unrecognized_option` runs `pylint` with the unrecognized option `-Q`.
3. **Error Handling**: The error and output are captured and checked for specific patterns indicating whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.
4. **Print Statements**: Depending on the outcome, appropriate messages are printed.

This test script should be run in an environment where `pylint` is installed. It will print "Issue reproduced" if the traceback issue is still present, "Issue resolved" if the unrecognized option is handled properly without a traceback, and "Other issues" if neither condition is met or another exception occurs.

        stdout = result.stdout
        stderr = result.stderr

        # Check if the expected error message is in stderr

This test script does the following:
1. Runs the `pylint` command with an unrecognized option (`-Q`).
2. Captures the standard output and standard error.
3. Checks if the expected error message is present in the stderr.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the expected error message is found without a traceback.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if a traceback is found in the stderr.
6. Prints "Other issues" if the outcome is different from the expected behavior or if there is another exception.

This script can be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify if the issue has been fixed.

This test script does the following:

1. **Imports** the necessary module `subprocess`.
2. Executes the `pylint -Q` command using `subprocess.run` and captures both the standard output and standard error.
3. **Checks**:
   - If the error message "Unrecognized option found: Q" is present in the captured standard error.
   - If a traceback is also present in the captured standard error.
4. Based on the checks, it prints:
   - "Issue reproduced" if the traceback is present.
   - "Issue resolved" if the traceback is not present but the unrecognized option error is.
   - "Other issues" if neither condition is met or if there is an exception.

This test should help in identifying the presence of the traceback for unrecognized options, thereby reproducing the issue described.

### Explanation of the Test:

1. **Imports**:
    - `Run` from `pylint.lint`: This is used to run the pylint command.
    - `_UnrecognizedOptionError` from `pylint.config.exceptions`: This is the specific error raised when an unrecognized option is passed to pylint.

2. **Test Function**:
    - The function `test_unrecognized_option_traceback` is defined to reproduce the issue.
    - A try-except block is used to catch specific exceptions.
        - **Main Try Block**: 
            - Runs pylint with the unrecognized `-Q` option.
        - **Except for `_UnrecognizedOptionError`**: 
            - If this specific error is caught, it indicates that the issue is reproduced as the traceback is part of this error.
            - Prints "Issue reproduced".
        - **General Exception**: 
            - Catches all other exceptions and indicates there might be other issues.
            - Prints "Other issues" and the exception message.
        - **Else Block**:
            - If no exception is raised, it indicates the issue might have been resolved.
            - Prints "Issue resolved".

3. **Running the Test Function**:
    - Calls `test_unrecognized_option_traceback()` to execute the test and determine the state of the issue.

This test will help in identifying if the traceback is printed (issue reproduced) or if it has been handled properly (issue resolved) or if there are other underlying issues.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The test imports `subprocess` to run the `pylint` command and `sys` to get the path of the current Python interpreter.
2. **Function Definition**: `test_pylint_unrecognized_option()` is defined to encapsulate the test logic.
3. **Running Pylint**: The function uses `subprocess.run` to execute the `pylint -Q` command, capturing both `stdout` and `stderr`.
4. **Output Concatenation**: Both `stdout` and `stderr` are combined into a single string, `output`.
5. **Issue Checks**:
    - If the output contains the unrecognized option error along with a traceback, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If the output contains the unrecognized option error without a traceback, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - For any other conditions or exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

This test will help you determine if the traceback is still being printed for unrecognized options, thereby verifying if the issue persists or has been resolved.

3. Executes `pylint -Q` using the `subprocess` module to capture the output.
4. Checks if the process returns a non-zero exit code to indicate an error.
5. Analyzes the error output to check if it contains the expected unrecognized option error and a traceback.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the traceback is present, indicating the issue has been reproduced.
7. Prints "Issue resolved" if the traceback is not present, indicating the issue has been resolved.
8. Prints "Other issues" if the output does not contain the expected error message.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary imports include `subprocess` to run the shell command and `sys` to get the Python interpreter path.
2. **Command Execution**: The `subprocess.run` function is used to run the `pylint` command with the unrecognized `-Q` option.
3. **Output Checking**: The output is checked for the presence of the "Unrecognized option found" message. If a traceback is also present, it prints "Issue reproduced". If no traceback is present, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. **Error Handling**: Any exceptions during the process will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test will help in both reproducing the issue where a traceback is printed and verifying if the issue has been resolved (i.e., no traceback is printed).
