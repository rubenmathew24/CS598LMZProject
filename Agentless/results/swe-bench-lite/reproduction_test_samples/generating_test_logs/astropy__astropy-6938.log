--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Possible bug in io.fits related to D exponents
I came across the following code in ``fitsrec.py``:

```python
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
```

I think this may be incorrect because as far as I can tell ``replace`` is not an in-place operation for ``chararray`` (it returns a copy). Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Creates a FITS record array with columns that have 'D' exponents in their format.
3. Writes this array to a FITS file in memory.
4. Reads the FITS file back and attempts to replace the 'E' exponent separator with 'D'.
5. Compares the original and modified arrays to determine if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

The test will print "Issue reproduced" if the original and modified arrays are the same, indicating that the `replace` method did not work as intended. It will print "Issue resolved" if the arrays are different, indicating that the `replace` method worked correctly. If there are other issues, it will print "Other issues".

This test script should be able to:
1. Reproduce the issue with the `replace` method not being in-place.
2. Verify if the issue has been fixed if the `replace` operation works as intended (i.e., changes 'D' to 'E').
3. Identify if there are other issues in the source code related to this functionality.

To run this test, ensure the `astropy` library is installed in your environment. The test writes a temporary FITS file to disk, reads it back, and checks if the exponent separator 'D' is properly replaced by 'E'.

This test script:
1. Imports the necessary `numpy` library.
2. Sets up sample data that includes 'D' exponents.
3. Defines an `encode_ascii` function to mimic potential encoding used in `fitsrec.py`.
4. Simulates the code that is supposed to replace 'E' with 'D' in the exponents.
5. Checks if the `output_field` has been modified correctly and prints the appropriate message.

This allows you to reproduce the issue and verify if the bug has been resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:**
   Imported necessary modules from `numpy` and `astropy.io.fits`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   Created a FITS record array with a floating point field to simulate the conditions described in the issue.
3. **Print Statements:**
   - If the original `output_field` is not modified (issue reproduced), it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the issue is resolved (i.e., the original `output_field` is modified correctly), it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Added an extra check to ensure the output matches the expected modified output and prints "Other issues" if there are discrepancies.

This test should help in verifying the behavior of the `replace` functionality as described in the issue.

Explanation:
1. The necessary imports from `numpy` and `astropy.io.fits` are included.
2. A dummy FITS record array with fields using 'E' and 'D' exponents is created.
3. The FITS record array is converted to a `chararray`.
4. The code that is suspected to be incorrect (`replace(b'E', b'D')`) is applied to the 'D' field.
5. The test checks if the replacement is in-place by comparing the original and replaced fields.
6. If the original and replaced fields are the same, it prints "Issue reproduced", otherwise "Issue resolved".
7. An additional check ensures no other issues are present by verifying that the data in the output field hasn't unintentionally changed.

This test should help in both reproducing and verifying the resolution of the issue described.

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The test begins by importing necessary modules, specifically `numpy`.
2. **Setup:** A `numpy` chararray `output_field` is created with strings that use 'D' as the exponent separator.
3. **Replacement Attempt:** The code from the issue is executed, which attempts to replace 'D' with 'E' in the chararray.
4. **Validation:** The test checks if the replacement was done correctly:
   - If `output_field` still contains 'D', it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If `output_field` contains 'E', it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other outcomes print "Other issues".
5. **Error Handling:** The test includes a try-except block to catch any unexpected exceptions and print "Other issues".
6. **Dummy Function:** A dummy `encode_ascii` function is defined to simulate the behavior of the actual function from the `fitsrec.py` module. 

Running this test will help identify if the issue with the `replace` operation is present or if it has been resolved.

test_fitsrec_D_exponents()
```

**Explanation of the test:**
1. **Necessary imports:** The test includes necessary imports from NumPy and Astropy's `fits` module.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:**
   - A dummy FITS record is created with a column containing floating-point numbers with 'D' exponents.
   - The dummy record is written to a temporary FITS file in memory.
   - The FITS file is then read back, and the field with 'D' exponents is extracted.
   - The code attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in the field values.
3. **Outcome checking and printing:**
   - If the replacement results in 'D' in the resulting string, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If 'E' is still present, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If neither 'D' nor 'E' are found, it prints "Other issues".

This test will help ensure that the behavior described in the issue text is correctly handled and can be used to verify if the issue has been resolved in future code versions.

This test should be placed within your testing framework. It initializes a `chararray` with floating point numbers containing 'E' exponents and then attempts to replace 'E' with 'D'. If the replace method does not work in-place, the array will remain unchanged, and the test will output "Issue reproduced". If the issue is resolved (i.e., the replace method works as intended), it will print "Issue resolved". If there are any other unexpected issues, it will print "Other issues".

The test does the following:
1. Imports the required `numpy` module.
2. Defines a test function `test_fitsrec_D_exponent_issue`.
3. Sets up the initial conditions to mimic the behavior described in the issue text.
4. Checks whether the replace operation was successful.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the replace operation is successful, "Issue reproduced" if it is not, and "Other issues" if any other exception occurs.

Make sure to place this test in an appropriate test file within your repository and run it to see if it reproduces the issue and verifies the fix.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Only `numpy` is imported as the functionality revolves around the `chararray` class from this library.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: 
   - A mocked `output_field` is created with example floating-point numbers.
   - The core part of the code from the issue is replicated.
3. **Outcome Checks**:
   - If the original `output_field` remains unmodified when compared to `modified_output_field`, it indicates that the `replace` method did not work as intended, hence printing "Issue reproduced".
   - If the `replace` method works correctly and modifies the `output_field` to have 'D' instead of 'E', it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other outcome is covered under "Other issues".

test_fitsrec_d_exponent_issue()
```

Here's a breakdown of how this test addresses the issue:
1. **Imports:** Import necessary modules `numpy` and `FITS_rec` from `astropy.io.fits`.
2. **Data Setup:** Create a sample `FITS_rec` object with a format that includes 'D' exponent notation. The data contains floating-point numbers viewed as `chararray`.
3. **Simulate Code Behavior:** Simulate the behavior present in the original code snippet by applying the `replace` operation.
4. **Check Results:** Verify if the `replace` operation worked correctly. If it didn't, the issue is reproduced. If it worked, the issue is resolved.
5. **Exception Handling:** Catch and print any other issues that might occur during the execution to ensure comprehensive testing.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue as well as verify its resolution.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Imports `numpy` which is needed to create and manipulate `chararray`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Simulates the scenario by creating a `chararray` with 'D' exponent and then attempts to replace 'E' with 'D'.
3. **Outcome checks**: If the replace operation is not performed in-place, the original `field` will remain unchanged, hence indicating the issue. If the replace operation is performed correctly, the output should match the expected result and print "Issue resolved".
4. **Exception Handling**: Catches any other issues and prints them.

test_fitsrec_D_exponent_replacement()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary imports include `numpy` (for creating arrays) and `astropy.io.fits` (for handling FITS files).
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - A FITS record is created with a column that has a 'D' exponent format.
   - The `replace` operation is attempted on the `output_field`.
3. **Output and Verification**:
   - If the `replace` operation does not modify the `output_field` (indicating the issue), "Issue reproduced" is printed.
   - If the `replace` operation works as intended, "Issue resolved" is printed.
   - If there are any other issues, they are printed under "Other issues".

This test essentially checks whether the `replace` operation has an effect on the `output_field`, which will help in identifying if the issue is present or if it has been resolved.

4. Applies this function to the original array and checks if the modification was successful.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the replacement was successful, "Issue reproduced" if it was not, and "Other issues" if any exceptions were raised during execution.
