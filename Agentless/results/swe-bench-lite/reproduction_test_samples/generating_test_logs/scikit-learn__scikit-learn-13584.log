Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.

3. Attempts to print the `LogisticRegressionCV` object with `Cs` set to a numpy array, which is expected to raise a `ValueError` as described in the issue.
4. Catches the specific `ValueError` to check if it indicates the same issue described.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific `ValueError` is raised.
6. Prints "Other issues" if a different error is raised.
7. Prints "Issue resolved" if no error is raised, indicating the issue has been fixed.

Explanation:
1. The necessary imports are included at the beginning.
2. The code to reproduce the issue is contained within the `test_print_changed_only_bug` function.
3. It attempts to print the `LogisticRegressionCV` instance with `Cs` set to a numpy array.
4. If the issue is reproduced, it catches the `ValueError` and checks if the error message matches the one described in the issue text, and prints "Issue reproduced".
5. If another type of exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
6. If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

    try:
        sklearn.set_config(print_changed_only=True)

```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The necessary modules and functions are imported.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The code sets the `sklearn` configuration to `print_changed_only=True` and attempts to print a `LogisticRegressionCV` object with an array for the `Cs` parameter.
3. **Outcome handling**:
   - If the `ValueError` with the specific message is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the code executes without raising the specific `ValueError`, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any other exceptions are raised, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test should help in both reproducing the issue and verifying if the issue is resolved.

3. Attempts to create and print a `LogisticRegressionCV` object with a vector of values for the `Cs` parameter.
4. Checks for the specific `ValueError` and prints "Issue reproduced" if the error message matches the reported issue.
5. Prints "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised or if the error message does not match.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exceptions are raised, indicating the problem is fixed.

You can use this script to verify whether the issue is present and whether it has been fixed after making changes to the codebase.

test_print_changed_only_issue()
```

This test performs the following:
1. Imports necessary modules (`sklearn`, `numpy`, `LogisticRegressionCV`).
2. Sets the `print_changed_only` configuration to `True`.
3. Attempts to print an instance of `LogisticRegressionCV` with a vector for the `Cs` parameter.
4. Captures the specific `ValueError` described in the issue and prints "Issue reproduced" if it matches the expected error.
5. Prints "Other issues" if a different exception occurs.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception occurs, implying the issue has been fixed.

Sure, here is the complete test to reproduce and verify the issue described in the provided issue text:

```python
import numpy as np
import sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV

def test_print_changed_only_issue():
    try:
        sklearn.set_config(print_changed_only=True)
        # Attempt to create a LogisticRegressionCV instance with a numpy array for Cs
        print(LogisticRegressionCV(Cs=np.array([0.1, 1])))
        print("Issue resolved")
    except ValueError as e:
        if 'The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()' in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced")
        else:
            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {str(e)}")

test_print_changed_only_issue()
```

This test script includes the necessary imports, reproduces the issue described, and checks the outcome to print the appropriate message. If the specific `ValueError` message is encountered, it prints "Issue reproduced". If no exception occurs, it prints "Issue resolved". Any other exceptions are caught and result in printing "Other issues".
