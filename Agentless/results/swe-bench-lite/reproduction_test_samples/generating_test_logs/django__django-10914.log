--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.
Description
	
Hello,
As far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.
What I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.
I found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."
        assert result[1]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'NVL'."

It then creates a small file (which will be handled by `MemoryUploadedFile`) and a large file (which will be handled by `TemporaryUploadedFile`), saves them using `FileSystemStorage`, and checks their file system permissions.\n3. **Outcome handling**: The test checks the permissions of the created files. If the permissions are as expected (`0o644`), it prints "Issue resolved". If the permissions of either file are `0o600`, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicative of the issue described. If another issue is found, it will print "Other issues".\n4. **Clean up**: The test ensures that the created files are removed after the check to avoid leaving temporary files.\n\nThis test will help in identifying whether the file upload permission inconsistency still exists and verifying if it has been resolved.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)), Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=6, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='```python\nimport os\nimport tempfile\nfrom django.core.files.uploadedfile import TemporaryUploadedFile, MemoryUploadedFile\nfrom django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage\n\ndef test_file_upload_permissions():\n    # Function to check the permissions of a file\n    def get_permissions(file_path):\n        return oct(os.stat(file_path).st_mode)[-3:]\n\n    # Creating a FileSystemStorage instance to emulate file upload\n    storage = FileSystemStorage()\n\n    # Create a small in-memory file\n    small_file = MemoryUploadedFile(name="small_file.txt", content_type="text/plain", size=10, charset="utf-8")\n    small_file.write(b"small content")\n    small_file.seek(0)\n\n    # Create a large temporary file\n    large_file = TemporaryUploadedFile(name="large_file.txt", content_type="text/plain", size=10**6, charset="utf-8")\n    large_file.write(b"large content" * (10**5))\n    large_file.seek(0)\n\n    # Save the small file using FileSystemStorage\n    small_file_path = storage.save("small_file.txt", small_file)\n    small_file_permissions = get_permissions(storage.path(small_file_path))\n\n    # Save the large file using FileSystemStorage\n    large_file_path = storage.save("large_file.txt", large_file)\n    large_file_permissions = get_permissions(storage.path(large_file_path))\n\n    # Check if the issue is reproduced\n    if small_file_permissions == \'644\' and large_file_permissions == \'600\':\n        print("Issue reproduced")\n        return\n    elif small_file_permissions == \'644\' and large_file_permissions == \'644\':\n        print("Issue resolved")\n        return\n    else:\n        print("Other issues")\n        return\n\ntest_file_upload_permissions()\n```\n\nThis test accomplishes the following:\n1.

This script performs the following tasks:
1. Sets up a temporary directory to simulate the `MEDIA_ROOT`.
2. Uses `FileSystemStorage` to save a small file (simulating `MemoryUploadedFile`) and a large file (simulating `TemporaryUploadedFile`).
3. Checks the file permissions for both uploaded files.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if both files have `0o644` permissions, "Issue reproduced" if the large file has `0o600` permissions, and "Other issues" if there are any other discrepancies.

You can run this test script to verify if the issue described has been reproduced or resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Necessary modules and classes are imported.
2. **Temporary Directory**: A temporary directory simulates the storage location.
3. **Small File Upload**: A `SimpleUploadedFile` (small file) is created and saved, then its permissions are checked.
4. **Large File Upload**: A `TemporaryUploadedFile` (large file) is created and saved, then its permissions are checked.
5. **Comparison**: The permissions of both files are compared.
6. **Output**: Depending on the permissions, appropriate messages are printed to indicate if the issue is resolved or reproduced, or if there are other issues.

2. It creates and uploads a small file (expected to be stored in memory) and a large file (expected to be stored as a temporary file).
3. It checks the permissions of both files.
4. It compares the permissions to the expected default permissions (`0o644`).
5. It outputs "Issue resolved" if both files have the expected permissions, "Issue reproduced" if they do not, and "Other issues" if any other error occurs.

test_file_upload_permission_issue()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports modules from Django for handling file uploads and managing settings.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test sets up Django settings to use default file upload handlers and no specific file upload permissions. It then creates a small file (which will be handled by `MemoryUploadedFile`) and a large file (which will be handled by `TemporaryUploadedFile`), saves them using `FileSystemStorage`, and checks their file system permissions.
3. **Outcome handling**: The test checks the permissions of the created files. If the permissions are as expected (`0o644`), it prints "Issue resolved". If the permissions of either file are `0o600`, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicative of the issue described. If another issue is found, it will print "Other issues".
4. **Clean up**: The test ensures that the created files are removed after the check to avoid leaving temporary files.

This test will help in identifying whether the file upload permission inconsistency still exists and verifying if it has been resolved.

    # Clean up
    os.remove(saved_file_location)
    os.rmdir(storage_location)

test_file_upload_permissions()
```

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import necessary modules for handling file uploads and temporary files.
2. **Setting Up Storage**: Create a temporary directory to simulate the file storage location and create an instance of `FileSystemStorage` pointing to this location.
3. **Creating Uploaded File**: Use `SimpleUploadedFile` to simulate a file upload.
4. **Saving the File**: Save the uploaded file using the `FileSystemStorage` instance.
5. **Checking File Permissions**: Get the file permissions of the saved file and compare them to the expected values:
   - If the permissions are `0o600`, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
   - If the permissions are `0o644`, it indicates the issue is resolved.
   - Otherwise, it prints "Other issues".
6. **Clean Up**: Remove the saved file and temporary directory to clean up after the test.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Necessary imports for the test, including `tempfile`, `os`, and Django's `TemporaryUploadedFile`, `SimpleUploadedFile`, and `FileSystemStorage`.
2. **Setup Test Files**:
   - `small_file`: Using `SimpleUploadedFile` to simulate a small file upload.
   - `large_file`: Using `TemporaryUploadedFile` with a temporary file created via `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` to simulate a large file upload.
3. **File Storage and Save**:
   - Using `FileSystemStorage` to save both small and large files.
4. **File Permissions Check**:
   - Fetching the permissions of the saved files using `os.stat()` and checking against the required `0o644` permissions.
5. **Cleanup**: Deleting the created files to clean up.
6. **Assertions**:
   - If both files have permissions `0o644`, print "Issue resolved".
   - If either has `0o600`, print "Issue reproduced".
   - Otherwise, print "Other issues".

This test should help verify if the issue concerning file permissions is reproduced and if it has been resolved.

This test script will recreate the conditions described in the issue, specifically uploading files using `TemporaryUploadedFile` and `SimpleUploadedFile`, and then checking the permissions of the uploaded files. The script prints "Issue reproduced" if the permissions are inconsistent and set to `0o600`, "Issue resolved" if they are consistent and set to `0o644`, and "Other issues" if the permissions are something else.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Necessary modules such as `os`, `tempfile`, `SimpleUploadedFile`, `TemporaryUploadedFile`, and `FileSystemStorage` are imported.
2. **Temporary Directory**: A temporary directory is created to simulate the file upload.
3. **File Creation**: A `SimpleUploadedFile` is created with the name `test_file.txt` and content `Hello, World!`.
4. **File Upload**: The file is saved using `FileSystemStorage`.
5. **Permission Check**: The permissions of the saved file are checked and compared to the expected `0o644` permissions.
6. **Outcome**: Depending on the permissions of the saved file, the appropriate message is printed.

This test can be used to reproduce the issue (if the permissions are not `0o644`) and verify if the issue has been fixed (if the permissions are `0o644`).

Explanation:
1. Necessary Imports: The script imports necessary Django modules and os for file operations.
2. Code to Reproduce: The script sets up a test case using Django’s TestCase. It uploads a simple file using Django's FileSystemStorage and checks the resulting file's permissions.
3. Outcome Check: If the file permission is `0o644`, it prints "Issue resolved". If the permission differs, it prints "Issue reproduced". If any exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
4. Cleanup: The script ensures to clean up the temporary files and directories created during the test.

This script should be run in a Django environment with the necessary settings and configurations.

Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The necessary modules are imported.
2. **Setup**:
   - A `FileSystemStorage` instance is created.
   - A simple file with the name `test.txt` and content `Test content` is created using `SimpleUploadedFile`.
3. **File Saving**:
   - The file is saved using the `FileSystemStorage` instance.
   - The full path of the saved file is obtained.
4. **Permission Check**:
   - The permissions of the saved file are retrieved using `os.stat`.
   - The permissions are compared against the expected permissions (`0o644` for resolved and `0o600` for issue reproduced).
   - Depending on the comparison, it prints either "Issue resolved", "Issue reproduced", or "Other issues".
5. **Cleanup**: The test file is deleted after the check.

This test script should reproduce the issue as described in the issue text and also verify if the issue has been fixed.

Explanation:
1. **Imports:**
   - `os` and `tempfile` modules are used to handle file operations and temporary directories.
   - `SimpleUploadedFile` is used to simulate an uploaded file.
   - `FileSystemStorage` is used to handle file storage.

2. **Test Setup:**
   - A temporary directory is created to act as the file upload directory.
   - `FileSystemStorage` is initialized with the temporary directory.
   - A simple uploaded file (`testfile.txt`) with dummy content is created.

3. **File Upload and Permission Check:**
   - The uploaded file is saved using `FileSystemStorage`.
   - The path to the saved file is retrieved.
   - The permissions of the saved file are checked.
   - Depending on the permissions, the appropriate message is printed:
      - If the permissions are `0o600`, the issue is reproduced.
      - If the permissions are `0o644`, the issue is resolved.
      - For any other permissions or exceptions, "Other issues" is printed.

This test can be used to both reproduce the described issue and verify if it has been resolved.

Explanation:
1. The test simulates the file upload process using `SimpleUploadedFile` (for small files) and `TemporaryUploadedFile` (for larger files).
2. It creates a temporary directory to store the uploaded files.
3. It creates a small file directly in memory and a larger file using a temporary file.
4. The temporary file is renamed to simulate the final storage, mimicking Django's file handling behavior.
5. It checks the permissions of the final stored file and prints corresponding messages based on the permissions, as described in the issue.
6. Finally, it cleans up the temporary files and directory to ensure no side effects.

This script sets up a test for the issue described. It creates a temporary directory to simulate the media root and upload directory, defines the desired file upload permissions, and uses Django's `FileSystemStorage` to save a test file. After saving, it checks the file's permissions and prints "Issue reproduced" if the permissions do not match the expected default, "Issue resolved" if they do, or "Other issues" if any other exception is raised.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import necessary modules and configure Django settings.
2. **File Creation**: Create two files, one small (to use `MemoryUploadedFile`) and one large (to use `TemporaryUploadedFile`).
3. **File Storage**: Save files using `FileSystemStorage`.
4. **File Permissions**: Check file permissions after saving.
5. **Assertions and Cleanup**: Verify file permissions and print appropriate messages. Clean up created files after test execution.

test_file_upload_permissions()
```

This test script:
1. Imports the necessary modules.
2. Creates a temporary directory to simulate file storage.
3. Uses `FileSystemStorage` to store a small in-memory file and a large temporary file.
4. Checks the file permissions of both the small and large files.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the small file has `0o644` permissions and the large file has `0o600` permissions, indicating the issue described.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if both files have `0o644` permissions.
7. Prints "Other issues" if the permissions are different from the expected outcomes.

This test script does the following:
1. Sets up the necessary Django settings if they are not already configured.
2. Creates and uploads a file using `TemporaryUploadedFile` and checks the file permissions.
3. Creates and uploads a file using `InMemoryUploadedFile` and checks the file permissions.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the permissions are set correctly, "Issue reproduced" if the permissions are incorrect, and "Other issues" for any other general exceptions.
5. Cleans up the files created for the test.

You can run this script to verify if the issue is present and to confirm if any future changes resolve the issue.
