We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Abstract model field should not be equal across models
Description
	
Consider the following models:
class A(models.Model):
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
	myfield = IntegerField()
class B(A):
	pass
class C(A):
	pass
If I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.
len({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1
B._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')
We should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.
When adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.
I brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."
        assert result[1]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'NVL'."
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return

    return

test__rules__std_L060_raised()
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.

```

This test script does the following:
1. Defines the abstract model `A` with a field `myfield`.
2. Defines two concrete models `B` and `C` inheriting from `A`.
3. Retrieves the field `myfield` from both `B` and `C`.
4. Checks if the fields are considered equal, and prints "Issue reproduced" if they are, otherwise "Issue resolved".
5. Checks if the fields are de-duplicated in a set, and prints "Issue reproduced" if they are, otherwise "Issue resolved".
6. Checks for any other potential issues and prints "Other issues" if any assertion fails.

You can use this test to both reproduce the issue described and verify the resolution of the issue.

Explanation:
1. Imported necessary modules from Django.
2. Defined abstract model `A` with an `IntegerField` named `myfield`.
3. Defined two derived models `B` and `C`.
4. Retrieved `myfield` from both models and checked if they are considered equal by adding them to a set.
5. Printed "Issue reproduced" if the length of the set is 1 (indicating the fields are seen as equal and one is de-duplicated).
6. Printed "Issue resolved" if the length of the set is not 1 (indicating the fields are correctly seen as unequal).
7. Printed "Other issues" for any exceptions during the test execution.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary Django `models`.
2. Defines the abstract base class `A`, and the subclasses `B` and `C`.
3. Implements a test function `test_abstract_model_field_equality()` that checks if the fields from models `B` and `C` are treated as equal.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the fields are considered equal or are de-duplicated in a set.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the fields are not considered equal and are not de-duplicated in a set.
6. Prints "Other issues" if any other exception occurs during the test.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Imported `models` from `django.db`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - Defined an abstract base model `A` with a single `myfield` field.
   - Created two concrete subclasses `B` and `C` from the abstract model `A`.
   - Retrieved `myfield` from models `B` and `C`.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If `field_b` is equal to `field_c`, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating the issue is still present.
   - If `field_b` is not equal to `field_c`, it prints "Issue resolved", indicating the issue has been fixed.
   - Any other exceptions are caught and printed as "Other issues".

This script directly tests the comparison of fields from different models to verify if the fields are incorrectly considered equal.

4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the fields are de-duplicated (indicating the issue is present).
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the fields are not de-duplicated (indicating the issue has been fixed).
6. Prints "Other issues" followed by the specific error if any other exception occurs during execution.

# Running the test function
test_abstract_model_field_equality()
```

**Explanation:**
1. We define the models as described in the issue text.
2. In the `test_abstract_model_field_equality` function, we fetch the `myfield` from both models `B` and `C`.
3. We then check if the fields `field_b` and `field_c` are considered equal.
4. We also check if adding these fields to a set results in de-duplication.
5. Depending on the outcomes, we print the appropriate messages.

This test should reproduce the issue if it exists and verify if the issue has been resolved once the behavior is corrected.

```

This test script does the following:
1. Defines an abstract model `A` with a single field `myfield`.
2. Defines two subclasses `B` and `C` inheriting from `A`.
3. Retrieves the `myfield` field from both `B` and `C`.
4. Puts these two fields into a set and checks the length of the set.
5. If the length of the set is 1, it means the fields are considered equal, and the issue is reproduced.
6. If the length of the set is not 1, it means the fields are not considered equal, and the issue is resolved.
7. If any other issues arise during the test execution, it catches the exception and prints "Other issues".

This test sets up the scenario described in the issue text. It defines an abstract model `A` with a single `IntegerField` and then creates two concrete models `B` and `C` that inherit from `A`. The test then checks if the field objects from `B` and `C` are considered equal by adding them to a set and checking the set's length. If the set length is 1, it means the fields were considered equal, reproducing the issue. If the set length is not 1, the issue has been resolved. If there are any other issues (e.g., code execution errors), those will be caught and printed.

test_abstract_model_field_equality()
```

This test will:
1. Import the necessary modules and define the abstract base model `A` and two derived models `B` and `C`.
2. Retrieve the `myfield` fields for both models `B` and `C`.
3. Check if the fields compare as equal or if they are de-duplicated in a set.
4. Print "Issue reproduced" if the fields are considered equal (indicating the issue is still present), "Issue resolved" if they are not equal (indicating the issue is fixed), or "Other issues" if any other exceptions occur during the process.

To run the test, simply copy the code into a file and execute it within a Django project environment where the models are properly recognized and the Django setup is correctly configured.

This test script includes the necessary imports, the code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text, and the outcome handling to print whether the issue has been reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues. When you run this test, it will check if fields from the derived models `B` and `C` are considered equal. If they are, the issue is reproduced; if not, it is resolved. If any other exception occurs, it will print "Other issues" along with the exception details.

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(e)

test_abstract_model_field_equality()
```

This test script will:
1. Define the abstract model `A` and its subclasses `B` and `C`.
2. Retrieve `myfield` from both `B` and `C`.
3. Check if `myfield` from both models are considered equal.
4. Check if the fields are de-duplicated when placed in a set.
5. Print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is reproduced.
6. Print "Issue resolved" if the issue has been fixed.
7. Print "Other issues" if there are any unexpected errors.

You can run this script in your Django environment to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

Sure, here is the complete test to reproduce and verify the issue described in the issue text:

```python
from django.db import models

# Define the models as described in the issue text
class A(models.Model):

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(str(e))

# Run the test
test_abstract_model_field_equality()
```

This script does the following:
1. Defines the abstract model `A` and its subclasses `B` and `C`.
2. Retrieves the `myfield` field from both `B` and `C`.
3. Compares the fields for equality and checks if they are considered distinct in a set.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the fields compare as equal or are not considered distinct in a set.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the fields do not compare as equal and are considered distinct in a set.
6. Prints "Other issues" if any exceptions are raised during the process.

test_abstract_model_field_equality()
```

In this test:

1. We've imported the necessary modules from Django.
2. We've defined the abstract model `A` and the two inheriting models `B` and `C`.
3. We've extracted the `myfield` field from both models `B` and `C`.
4. We've created a set containing these fields and checked the length of the set to determine if the issue is reproduced.
5. Based on the length of the set and the equality comparison, we print whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

This test case defines abstract model `A` with subclasses `B` and `C`, and it checks if the `myfield` fields from `B` and `C` are incorrectly being considered equal. The test will print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is present, "Issue resolved" if the issue has been fixed, or "Other issues" if any other exception occurs.
