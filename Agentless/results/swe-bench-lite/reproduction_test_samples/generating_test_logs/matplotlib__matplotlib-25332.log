[Bug]: Unable to pickle figure with aligned labels
### Bug summary

 Unable to pickle figure after calling `align_labels()`

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pickle

fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(211)
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(212)
time=[0,1,2,3,4]
speed=[40000,4300,4500,4700,4800]
acc=[10,11,12,13,14]
ax1.plot(time,speed)
ax1.set_ylabel('speed')
ax2.plot(time,acc)
ax2.set_ylabel('acc')

fig.align_labels() ##pickling works after removing this line 

pickle.dumps(fig)
plt.show()
```


### Actual outcome
```

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."
        assert result[1]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'NVL'."

        return

    return

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules (`matplotlib.pyplot` and `pickle`).
2. Reproduces the issue by creating a figure, adding subplots, plotting data, and using `align_labels()` method.
3. Attempts to pickle the figure and catches exceptions to determine if the issue is reproduced.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised, "Issue reproduced" if the specific TypeError is encountered, and "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

This script performs the following:
1. Sets up the figure and axes as described in the issue.
2. Calls `align_labels()`, which is known to cause the pickling issue.
3. Attempts to pickle the figure and handles the `TypeError` specific to the `weakref.ReferenceType`.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the pickling is successful, "Issue reproduced" if the specific error occurs, and "Other issues" if any other exception is raised.

test_pickle_figure_with_aligned_labels()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary modules `matplotlib.pyplot` and `pickle` are imported.
2. **Function Definition**: A function `test_pickle_figure_with_aligned_labels` is defined to encapsulate the test case.
3. **Figure Creation**: A figure and two subplots are created, and then data is plotted on these subplots.
4. **Label Alignment**: The `fig.align_labels()` method is called, which is suspected to cause the pickling issue.
5. **Pickling Attempt**: The figure object `fig` is pickled using `pickle.dumps(fig)`.
6. **Exception Handling**:
   - If a `TypeError` is raised with the specific message `"cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object"`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other `TypeError` or any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
7. **Successful Pickling**: If no exceptions are raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

This script can be run to check whether the issue is reproduced or resolved.

2. Creates a figure with two subplots.
3. Sets up some sample data and plots it on the subplots.
4. Calls `fig.align_labels()` which is supposed to cause the issue.
5. Attempts to pickle the figure, and handles the possible outcomes:
   - If a `TypeError` related to pickling is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If no error occurs, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - For any other exception, it prints "Other issues".

This code sets up the environment to reproduce the issue described. It will attempt to pickle a Matplotlib figure after aligning labels, and it will print an appropriate message based on the outcome:

- "Issue reproduced" if the error `TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object` occurs.
- "Issue resolved" if pickling succeeds without any exceptions.
- "Other issues" if any other type of exception occurs.

This test script follows the steps outlined in the issue text to reproduce the bug. It:
1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Reproduces the described issue by creating a figure, aligning labels, and attempting to pickle it.
3. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific TypeError is encountered, indicating that the issue is still present.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised, indicating that the issue has been fixed.
5. Prints "Other issues" if any other exception occurs.

test_pickle_figure_with_aligned_labels()
```

This test script performs the following steps:
1. Creates a figure with subplots and plots some data.
2. Aligns the labels to reproduce the issue.
3. Attempts to pickle the figure and checks the type of exception raised.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised, "Issue reproduced" if the specific `TypeError` indicating the issue is raised, and "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

This test script sets up the scenario as described in the issue, and it includes logic to catch and identify whether the specific issue with pickling the figure is reproduced, has been resolved, or if there are other issues with the code.

# Run the test
test_pickle_figure_with_aligned_labels()
```

This test attempts to reproduce the issue as described. If it encounters a `TypeError` related to `weakref.ReferenceType`, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the code runs without issues and completes the pickling process, it prints "Issue resolved". For any other exceptions or issues, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception information.

test_pickle_figure_with_aligned_labels()
```

This script will:
1. Import the necessary modules.
2. Setup and generate the figure with aligned labels as described in the issue.
3. Attempt to pickle the figure.
4. Print "Issue resolved" if pickling is successful.
5. Print "Issue reproduced" if the specific `TypeError` related to pickling `weakref.ReferenceType` occurs.
6. Print "Other issues" if any other exceptions occur.
