--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Allow ValidationErrors to equal each other when created identically
Description
	 
		(last modified by kamni)
	 
Currently ValidationErrors (django.core.exceptions.ValidationError) that have identical messages don't equal each other, which is counter-intuitive, and can make certain kinds of testing more complicated. Please add an __eq__ method that allows two ValidationErrors to be compared. 
Ideally, this would be more than just a simple self.messages == other.messages. It would be most helpful if the comparison were independent of the order in which errors were raised in a field or in non_field_errors.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."
        assert result[1]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'NVL'."
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return

    return

test__rules__std_L060_raised()
```

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Create two instances of `ValidationError` with identical messages.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If the two `ValidationError` instances are not equal, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating that the issue still exists.
   - If the two instances are equal, it prints "Issue resolved", meaning the issue has been fixed.
4. **Other issues**: If any exceptions occur, it prints "Other issues" with the exception information.

Here's a complete test that will help reproduce the issue described in the issue text for `ValidationError` in Django:

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def test_validation_error_equality():
    try:
        # Create two ValidationError objects with identical messages
        error1 = ValidationError(["Error 1", "Error 2"])
        error2 = ValidationError(["Error 1", "Error 2"])

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    return

test_validation_error_equality()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The `ValidationError` class is imported from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Two `ValidationError` instances with identical messages are created.
3. **Comparison**: The test checks if the two instances are considered equal.
4. **Output**:
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if the instances are considered equal (indicating the issue has been fixed).
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the instances are not considered equal (indicating the issue is still present).
   - Prints "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised during execution.

This test can both reproduce the issue as well as verify if the issue has been fixed once the `__eq__` method is implemented for `ValidationError`.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The `ValidationError` class from `django.core.exceptions` is imported.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Two `ValidationError` instances (`error1` and `error2`) are created with identical messages.
   - Another two `ValidationError` instances (`error3` and `error4`) are created with the same messages but in different order.
3. **Outcome Checks**:
   - If `error1` and `error2` are not equal, the script prints "Issue reproduced" and terminates.
   - If `error3` and `error4` are not equal, the script prints "Issue reproduced" and terminates.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, the script prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other exceptions will result in printing "Other issues" and the exception message.

This test can be used to check whether the issue described in the issue text has been resolved or still persists.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The import statement is included to bring in the `ValidationError` class from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
    - Two instances of `ValidationError` are created with identical messages.
    - The current issue should show that these two instances are not equal (`error1 != error2`), which will reproduce the issue.
3. **Outcome Messages:**
    - If the two instances are not equal, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If they are equal, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Assertion:**
    - The assertion `assert error1 == error2` is meant to verify if the issue is resolved. If the issue is fixed and the `__eq__` method is implemented correctly, this assertion will pass, and the function will print "Issue resolved".

This test should be able to reproduce the issue and verify whether it has been fixed.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary import `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - Create two `ValidationError` instances with identical messages (`error1` and `error2`).
   - Create another `ValidationError` instance (`error3`) with the same messages but in a different order.
3. **Print statements**:
   - If `error1` is not equal to `error2`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If `error1` is not equal to `error3`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If both tests pass (assertions hold true), it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Other issues".

This test script will help you reproduce the issue described in the issue text. Here's what it does:
1. Imports the necessary `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. Creates two `ValidationError` instances with the same message.
3. Compares these two instances.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if they are considered equal.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if they are not considered equal.
6. Prints "Other issues" if any other exception occurs during the comparison.

To run this test, you should have Django installed in your environment. This test will initially print "Issue reproduced" based on the current behavior described in the issue text. After implementing the `__eq__` method for `ValidationError`, you can rerun this test to verify that it prints "Issue resolved".

This test script checks the equality of `ValidationError` instances. According to the issue description, currently, even identical `ValidationError` instances are not considered equal, which is counter-intuitive and complicates testing. 

The script attempts to:
1. Create two `ValidationError` instances with identical error messages, and verifies if they are not equal (which reproduces the issue).
2. Create another `ValidationError` with the same messages but in a different order, and verifies if they are equal to the first one (only if the issue is resolved).

It prints "Issue reproduced" if the identical `ValidationError` instances are not considered equal, "Issue resolved" if equality works correctly without order dependency, and "Other issues" if any other unexpected behavior is encountered.

    - Two `ValidationError` instances are created with identical messages.
    - The test checks if these two instances are considered equal.
3. **Print Statements**: 
    - "Issue reproduced" is printed if the two instances are not considered equal, indicating the issue still exists.
    - "Issue resolved" is printed if the two instances are considered equal, indicating the issue has been fixed.
    - "Other issues" is printed if any unexpected exceptions arise.

This test should faithfully reproduce the issue if it exists, and verify the fix if applied.

This test script performs the following steps:
1. Imports the necessary `ValidationError` class from Django's core exceptions module.
2. Defines a function `test_validation_error_equality` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Inside the function, it creates two `ValidationError` instances with identical messages.
4. Checks if these two instances are considered equal.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the instances are considered equal, "Issue reproduced" if they are not, and "Other issues" if any exceptions occur during the test.

```

Here is an explanation of the test:
1. **Imports**: The necessary import for `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. **Test Function**:
    - Creates four `ValidationError` instances. `error1` and `error2` have identical messages in the same order, while `error3` and `error4` have identical messages but in a different order.
    - The first `try` block checks if two `ValidationError` instances with identical messages are not considered equal. If they are not equal, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - The second `try` block checks if two `ValidationError` instances with identical messages but in a different order are not considered equal. If they are not equal, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If no assertions are raised, it means the issue is resolved, and it prints "Issue resolved".
3. **Exception Handling**: If any other exceptions are raised during the test execution, it catches them and prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test can be used both to reproduce the issue and to verify that the issue has been fixed.

test_validation_error_equality()
```

### Explanation

1. **Imports:** The test imports `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. **Reproduction Code:**
   - Two `ValidationError` instances (`error1` and `error2`) are created with identical messages.
   - The script checks if `error1` equals `error2`.
   - If they are equal, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If they are not equal, it prints "Issue reproduced".
3. **Order Independence Check:**
   - Two `ValidationError` instances with lists of messages in different orders are created.
   - The script checks if `error1` equals `error2` with an order-independent check.
   - If they are equal, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If they are not equal, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. **Other Issues:**
   - Any exceptions are caught and printed as "Other issues".

You can run this script to see if the current behavior matches the expected outcome and adjust your code to implement the `__eq__` method in the `ValidationError` class if needed.

3. The test creates multiple `ValidationError` instances to verify their equality under different conditions, specifically focusing on identical messages and messages in different orders.
4. Assertions are used to check if the `ValidationError` instances are considered equal or not based on the issue description.
5. The `print` statements are used to provide feedback on the outcome of the test, indicating whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.
