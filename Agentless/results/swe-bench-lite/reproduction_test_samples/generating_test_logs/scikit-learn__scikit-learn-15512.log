--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering
The affinity propagation Documentation states: 
"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample."

Example:
```python
from sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])
af = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)

print(af.cluster_centers_indices_)
print(af.labels_)

```
I would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. 
The only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).
I am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?

For my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.

Explanation of the test:
1. **Imports**: The necessary libraries `AffinityPropagation` from `sklearn.cluster` and `pandas` are imported.
2. **Data Preparation**: A DataFrame is created with the data specified in the issue.
3. **AffinityPropagation**: The `AffinityPropagation` model is initialized with `max_iter=2` to enforce non-convergence as specified.
4. **Cluster Centers and Labels**: After fitting the model, the cluster centers and labels are printed.
5. **Issue Check**: The code checks if the cluster centers are not empty and labels are not -1, indicating the issue is reproduced. If the cluster centers are empty and all labels are -1, it indicates the issue is resolved. Otherwise, it prints "Other issues".

1. Imports the necessary libraries.
2. Sets up the data.
3. Performs Affinity Propagation clustering with a low `max_iter` to force non-convergence.
4. Checks the expected behavior: if `cluster_centers_indices` is empty and all `labels` are `-1` (as stated in the original issue's expected behavior).
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the behavior matches the expectation, otherwise prints "Issue reproduced".
6. Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" if there are other problems.

You can use this script to reproduce the issue and verify if any changes resolve it.

Certainly! Below is a complete test script that can be used to reproduce the issue described in the issue text. The test script will check the output of the AffinityPropagation clustering and print the appropriate messages based on the outcome.

```python

from sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation

def test_affinity_propagation_convergence():
    data = pd.DataFrame([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]])

        print("Issue reproduced")
    else:
        print("Other issues")

test_affinity_propagation_convergence()
```

This script performs the following steps:
1. Imports the necessary modules (`pandas` and `AffinityPropagation` from `sklearn.cluster`).
2. Defines a test function `test_affinity_propagation_convergence` that sets up the data and fits the AffinityPropagation model.
3. Checks the result of the clustering to see if it matches the expected non-converged output or the erroneous output described in the issue text.
4. Prints "Issue resolved", "Issue reproduced", or "Other issues" based on the outcome.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if a fix has been implemented correctly.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import the necessary libraries: `AffinityPropagation` from `sklearn.cluster` and `pandas`.
2. **Data Setup**: Create the data as a DataFrame.
3. **Model Setup**: Instantiate and fit the AffinityPropagation model with a very low `max_iter` to ensure it does not converge.
4. **Fetch Results**: Extract `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` from the fitted model.
5. **Expected Results**: Define the expected results for non-convergence based on the issue description.
6. **Assertions**: Use assertions to check if the actual results match the expected results. Print "Issue resolved" if the assertions are true, "Issue reproduced" if they fail, and handle any other exceptions by printing "Other issues".

This test can be run to verify if the issue described is reproducible, and can also be used after any fixes to ensure the issue is resolved.

This test script will help verify if the issue described in the issue text is reproduced or resolved. It checks if the clustering that does not converge returns an empty array for cluster centers and an array of -1s for labels as expected. If the actual output matches the expected output, it prints "Issue resolved". If not, it prints "Issue reproduced". If any other errors occur during the test, it prints "Other issues" along with the error message.

This test code aims to reproduce the issue described in the provided issue text. It initializes an `AffinityPropagation` object with a very low `max_iter` to ensure the algorithm does not converge. It then checks whether the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` attributes match the expected outputs for a non-converged scenario (empty list and all -1 labels, respectively). The output messages indicate whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import `AffinityPropagation` from `sklearn.cluster` and `pandas as pd`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: We create a test function `test_affinity_propagation_convergence_issue()`. Inside this function, we replicate the issue described by creating the data, setting up the `AffinityPropagation` with `max_iter=2`, and fitting it to the data.
3. **Prints for different outcomes**:
    - **Issue resolved**: If the `cluster_centers_indices` is an empty array and all `labels` are -1, we print "Issue resolved".
    - **Issue reproduced**: If the `cluster_centers_indices` contains one element `[2]` and all `labels` are 0, we print "Issue reproduced".
    - **Other issues**: If the outcome doesn't match either expected non-converged or reproduced issue outputs, we print "Other issues".

This test function will help verify if the issue is still present or if it has been resolved by changes in the `AffinityPropagation` implementation.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary libraries (sklearn and pandas) are imported.
2. **Data and Model Setup**: The data is created as specified in the issue, and the AffinityPropagation model is initialized with `max_iter=2` to ensure non-convergence.
3. **Fit the Model**: The AffinityPropagation model is fitted to the data, and `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` are obtained.
4. **Check for Convergence**:
   - If the number of iterations `n_iter_` equals the `max_iter`, it implies non-convergence.
   - If `cluster_centers_indices_` is empty and all labels are `-1`, then the issue is resolved.
   - If the above condition is not met, the issue is reproduced.
   - If the number of iterations is less than `max_iter`, there may be other issues which are indicated by printing "Other issues".
5. **Output**: The test function prints "Issue resolved", "Issue reproduced", or "Other issues" based on the outcome.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import necessary modules (`AffinityPropagation` from `sklearn.cluster` and `pandas`).
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the input data as specified in the issue description.
3. **Setup AffinityPropagation**: Create an `AffinityPropagation` object with `max_iter=2` to intentionally prevent the algorithm from converging.
4. **Fit the Model**: Fit the model to the data.
5. **Capture Results**: Capture the cluster centers indices and labels from the fitted model.
6. **Check Results**: Verify if the results match the expected outcome described in the issue (an empty list for cluster centers indices and `-1` for all labels).
7. **Output**: Print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is observed, otherwise print "Issue resolved". Additionally, handle any unexpected exceptions and print "Other issues" with the exception message.

This test ensures that the issue can be reproduced and verifying the fix would simply involve the test printing "Issue resolved".

test_affinity_propagation_non_convergence()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
   - `pandas` for data handling.
   - `AffinityPropagation` from `sklearn.cluster` for clustering.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text**:
   - A `DataFrame` is created with the sample data.
   - An instance of `AffinityPropagation` is created with a small `max_iter` to ensure non-convergence.
   - The `fit` method is called to perform clustering on the data.

3. **Print statements for different outcomes**:
   - The function checks if `cluster_centers_indices_` is empty and if `labels_` contains only `-1`. If both conditions are met, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If `cluster_centers_indices_` is not empty or `labels_` contains values other than `-1`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "Other issues".

This test will help determine if the `AffinityPropagation` clustering correctly indicates non-convergence by returning empty cluster centers and `-1` labels, as expected per the documentation.

Note: The `converged_` attribute is not available in the sklearn version (0.20.3) mentioned in the issue statement. If using a newer version of sklearn where `converged_` is available, this code would work as intended to check convergence directly. If not, you'll need to check other conditions as per your requirement.

This test script:
1. Imports the necessary modules (`numpy`, `pandas`, and `AffinityPropagation` from `sklearn`).
2. Reproduces the issue described, by running `AffinityPropagation` with a low `max_iter` to ensure non-convergence.
3. Compares the output to the expected non-converged output.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the expected non-converged output is observed, otherwise prints "Issue reproduced" or "Other issues" based on the results, helping diagnose whether the code behaves as expected, reproduces the issue, or faces other unexpected issues.
