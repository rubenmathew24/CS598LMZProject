--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()
Python 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:

```python
app.config.from_file("config.toml", tomllib.load)
```

However, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:

```
TypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`
```

We can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:

```python
# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does
with open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, "config.toml"), "rb") as file:
    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))
```

But adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:

```python
app.config.from_file("config.toml", tomllib.load, mode="b")
```

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `Flask`, `Config`, and `tomllib` which are necessary for the task.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: The script first creates a sample TOML file, tries to load this using `flask.Config.from_file()` in default text mode, and catches the `TypeError` if it occurs.
3. **Print Statements**: Depending on whether the `TypeError` with the expected message is caught, the script prints "Issue reproduced". If the exception message is different or if the configuration loads without an exception, it checks the configuration values and prints "Issue resolved". If none of these conditions are met, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Clean Up**: The script ensures that the created TOML file is removed after the test, to keep the environment clean.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports the necessary modules: `flask`, `tomllib`, and `os`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: A sample Flask application and a TOML configuration file are created. The test tries to load the configuration file using `app.config.from_file("config.toml", tomllib.load)`, which should reproduce the issue described.
3. **Outcome handling**: 
   - If a `TypeError` is raised with the specific message about the file needing to be opened in binary mode, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If no error is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.
4. **Cleaning up**: The temporary configuration file is removed at the end of the test to avoid leaving residual files.

You can run this script to verify the issue. If the issue has been successfully resolved (i.e., the `flask.Config.from_file()` method now supports a file mode parameter), you would modify the script accordingly to verify the resolution. In its current form, this script will print "Issue reproduced" indicating that the issue described in the text occurs. If the error message does not match, or another issue is encountered, it will print "Other issues".

test_flask_config_from_file_issue()
```

Explanation of the code:
1. The necessary imports are included: `flask`, `os`, `tomllib`, and `tempfile`.
2. A temporary directory is created using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` to safely manage the test files.
3. A temporary TOML configuration file is written with some dummy settings.
4. A Flask application instance is initialized.
5. The `from_file` method is called to load the configuration file using `tomllib.load`. If a `TypeError` with a specific message is raised, it means the issue is reproduced. If no exception or a different exception is raised, the script handles these cases accordingly.
6. The test function is called to execute the test.

This code should be able to reproduce the issue if it still exists and verify if it has been resolved once the issue is fixed.

This code creates a test for the issue described in the repository issue text. It sets up a Flask application and writes a TOML configuration file. It then tries to load this configuration using the `from_file` method and catches the expected `TypeError`. The test prints "Issue reproduced" if the error is due to the file needing to be opened in binary mode. If the configuration is loaded correctly, it checks the configuration values and prints "Issue resolved" if they are correct. Any other issues will result in "Other issues" being printed. Finally, it cleans up by deleting the temporary TOML file.

Explanation of test:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports `os`, `tomllib`, `Flask`, and `Config` classes.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - A `Flask` app instance is created.
   - A sample TOML configuration file is created in the app's root path.
   - An attempt is made to load the configuration file using `app.config.from_file()` without specifying binary mode.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If a `TypeError` with the message "File must be opened in binary mode" is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the configuration loads successfully, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other exceptions are caught and it prints "Other issues".

The test also ensures clean-up of the created configuration file after execution.

This test will:
1. Create a sample TOML file to be used as the configuration file.
2. Attempt to load this configuration file using `flask.Config.from_file()` without a mode parameter, expecting to reproduce the issue.
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the expected `TypeError` is raised, indicating the file mode issue.
4. Print "Other issues" if a different error occurs.
5. Print "Issue resolved" if the file is read correctly without errors.
6. The `simulate_resolution` function is provided to test the resolution once a mode parameter is added to `flask.Config.from_file()`. This block is currently commented out and can be uncommented to verify if the fix works correctly.
7. Clean up the temporary configuration file after the test.

To use the `simulate_resolution` function, you will need to modify `flask.Config.from_file()` to accept a `mode` parameter and handle file opening accordingly.

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: Necessary imports include `os`, `tomllib`, and `Flask` from the `flask` package.
2. **Setup**: The test creates a temporary Flask application and a sample TOML configuration file.
3. **Write TOML Config**: A sample TOML configuration is written to a file.
4. **Reproduction of Issue**: The test attempts to load the configuration using the `tomllib.load` function through `app.config.from_file()`.
5. **Outcome Handling**:
    - If a `TypeError` is raised with the specific message indicating the file must be opened in binary mode, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If the configuration loads successfully (i.e., the issue is fixed), it prints "Issue resolved".
    - For any other exceptions, it prints "Other issues".
6. **Cleanup**: The temporary TOML configuration file is removed to clean up after the test.

This test should help you reproduce the issue and verify if it has been resolved.

6. If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".
7. If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

Explanation:
1. Necessary imports: We import the required packages, including `os`, `tempfile`, `tomllib`, and `Flask`.
2. Code to reproduce the issue:
   - We create a temporary directory and a temporary TOML file using binary mode.
   - We initialize a Flask application and attempt to load the TOML config file using `flask.Config.from_file()`.
3. The function prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific `TypeError` indicating the file must be opened in binary mode is raised.
4. The function prints "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised, indicating that the issue has been fixed.
5. The function prints "Other issues" if any other exception is raised, indicating there may be other problems.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Import `os`, `tempfile`, `Flask` from `flask`, and `tomllib`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - A temporary TOML configuration file is created using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`.
    - The file is written with a sample TOML configuration.
    - `app.config.from_file()` is called without binary mode to reproduce the issue.
3. **Print statements**:
    - `"Issue resolved"`: Printed if `from_file()` does not raise an error (indicating the issue is fixed).
    - `"Issue reproduced"`: Printed if a `TypeError` is raised with the message about the file needing to be opened in binary mode (indicating the issue is present).
    - `"Other issues"`: Printed for any other exceptions that might indicate a different problem.

test_config_from_file_issue()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Import relevant packages including `os`, `tempfile`, and `tomllib` for TOML loading, and `Flask` from `flask`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - Create a temporary directory and a sample `config.toml` file within it.
    - Initialize a Flask app.
    - Attempt to load the configuration using `app.config.from_file(config_path, tomllib.load)` which will raise a `TypeError` since the file mode is not binary.
3. **Print outcome**:
    - If a `TypeError` with the message "File must be opened in binary mode" is raised, print "Issue reproduced".
    - If any other exception or issue occurs, print "Other issues".
    - If no exception is raised, print "Issue resolved".

Run this test script to determine if the issue is reproduced. If the issue is resolved (e.g., after adding a file mode parameter to `from_file`), the script should print "Issue resolved".
