--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Add check to ensure max_length fits longest choice.
Description
	
There is currently no check to ensure that Field.max_length is large enough to fit the longest value in Field.choices.
This would be very helpful as often this mistake is not noticed until an attempt is made to save a record with those values that are too long.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

2. Defines a sample model `SampleModel` with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` of 10 and choices that include a value longer than the `max_length`.
3. The test function `test_max_length_vs_choices` attempts to create an instance of `SampleModel` with a choice that exceeds the `max_length`.
4. If the instance is saved without raising an error, it prints "Issue reproduced".
5. If an `IntegrityError` is raised with a message indicating the value is too long, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be used to verify whether the issue described in the provided issue text has been reproduced and subsequently resolved.

This test aims to reproduce the issue mentioned in the issue text. It creates an instance of a Django model with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` of 10 and choices, one of which is longer than 10 characters. The test will check if a `ValidationError` is raised due to the length constraint being violated and will print the appropriate message based on the outcome.

test_max_length_with_choices()
```

This test script aims to:

1. Define a Django model with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` attribute and a list of `choices`.
2. Attempt to create and save an instance of this model where one of the choices exceeds the `max_length`.
3. Catch the relevant exceptions (`ValueError`, `IntegrityError`, `ValidationError`) and print the appropriate message based on the exception message content. 

**Explanation:**

- `CHOICES` contains three options, where `'very_long_choice'` is longer than the maximum allowed length of 10 characters.
- The `try` block attempts to save an instance of `TestModel` with the too-long choice.
- If the exception message indicates that the value is too long (`'value too long'` in the exception message), the script will print "Issue reproduced".
- If the operation succeeds or a different exception is raised, the script will print "Issue resolved" or "Other issues" respectively.

    except ValidationError:
        print("Issue resolved")

test_max_length_fits_longest_choice()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports necessary modules from Django to define a model and handle validation errors.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Defines a `TestModel` with a `CharField` and `choices`. Sets up a custom `clean` method to validate that `max_length` fits the longest choice.
3. **Print statements**: 
    - Prints "Other issues" if a `ValidationError` is raised for the shorter choice (indicating an unrelated problem).
    - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the longer choice does not raise a `ValidationError` (indicating the issue is present).
    - Prints "Issue resolved" if the longer choice raises a `ValidationError` (indicating the issue is fixed).

You can run this test to both reproduce the issue and verify if it is fixed.

```python
from django.db import models, IntegrityError

def test_max_length_fits_longest_choice():
    class SampleModel(models.Model):
        SAMPLE_CHOICES = [
            ('short', 'Short'),
            ('longer_than_max_length', 'Longer than Max Length')
        ]
        sample_field = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=SAMPLE_CHOICES)

    # Try to create an instance of the model with the longest choice
    try:
        instance = SampleModel(sample_field='longer_than_max_length')
        instance.save()
        print("Issue reproduced")

        # If an IntegrityError occurs, it means the max_length has not been properly checked
        print("Issue reproduced")
    except Exception as e:
        # If another kind of exception occurs, it means there could be other issues in the code

        # If no exception occurs, it means the issue has been resolved
        print("Issue resolved")

# Call the test function
test_max_length_fits_longest_choice()
```

In this test:
1. We define a `SampleModel` with a `sample_field` that has a `max_length` of 10 and choices that include a value longer than this length.
2. We attempt to save an instance of `SampleModel` with the longer choice.
3. If an `IntegrityError` is raised, we print "Issue reproduced" to indicate that the max_length constraint is not being properly enforced.
4. If another exception type is raised, we print "Other issues".
5. If no exception is raised, we print "Issue resolved", indicating that the issue has been fixed.

    # Run the test function
    test_max_length_checks()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports necessary Django modules like `models` and `IntegrityError`, and sets up Django.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - We create a Django model `MyModel` with choices where one of the choices exceeds the specified `max_length`.
   - We attempt to create and save an instance of `MyModel` with a value that exceeds the `max_length`.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the instance is saved without error, it means the issue is reproduced, and we print "Issue reproduced".
   - If an `IntegrityError` (or similar) is raised indicating that the max_length constraint works, we print "Issue resolved".
   - Any other exception is caught, and "Other issues" is printed along with the exception message for further debugging.

### Notes:
- Ensure your Django project settings file (`myproject.settings`) is correctly referenced, or adjust the path as necessary.
- The test checks if Django version is suitable as older versions might not support the test case correctly.
- This test script assumes it is run in the context of a properly configured Django application. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual project setup.

2. A model definition with choices and a max_length that will trigger the issue.
3. A test function to reproduce the issue.
4. Print statements to indicate the outcome.

Explanation:
- The `TestModel` class defines a `CharField` with a `max_length` that is less than the length of the longest choice in `CHOICES`.
- The `test_max_length_choice_validation` function attempts to create and save an instance of `TestModel` with a choice that exceeds `max_length`.
- If a `ValidationError` is raised specifically for the `choice_field`, it prints "Issue resolved".
- If any other error is encountered or if the error is not related to the `choice_field`, it prints "Other issues".
- If no error is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".

In this test:
1. We define a Django model `TestModel` with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` of 10 and a set of choices.
2. One of the choices is deliberately longer than the `max_length`.
3. We attempt to create an instance of `TestModel` with the longest choice value and call `full_clean()`, which should raise a `ValidationError`.
4. The test prints "Issue reproduced" if the `ValidationError` is not raised or does not contain the expected message.
5. If the `ValidationError` is raised and contains the expected message, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. Any other exceptions or unexpected behavior result in "Other issues" being printed.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Import necessary Django modules.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Define a `TestModel` with a `CharField` where `max_length` is less than the length of the longest choice.
3. **Validation**:
   - Attempt to create instances of `TestModel` with valid and invalid choices.
   - Catch `ValidationError` to check if it's due to max_length constraint.
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if the error is due to max_length constraint.
   - Print "Issue resolved" if no errors occur.
   - Print "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

This test will help in reproducing the issue by attempting to save a record with a choice value longer than the defined `max_length`, and it will also help in verifying if the issue has been resolved by checking if appropriate validation has been added.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import necessary Django classes and exceptions.
2. **Model Definition**: We define a sample model `ExampleModel` with `choices` that include a value longer than the specified `max_length` of the `CharField`.
3. **Test Case**: 
   - We attempt to create and save two records, one with a short valid choice and another with a choice that exceeds the `max_length`.
   - We handle exceptions to determine if the issue is reproduced or if other issues exist.

Running this script will help determine if the `max_length` constraint is correctly enforced and if the issue described in the issue text is reproduced or resolved.

This test script follows these steps:
1. Imports the necessary Django modules.
2. Defines a Django model `ExampleModel` with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` shorter than one of its choices, which should trigger the issue.
3. Defines a function `test_max_length_fits_longest_choice` that tests the creation of a record with both a short and a long value for the `field_with_choices` field.
4. Depending on the outcome of the tests, it prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues".

This test case attempts to create an instance of `ChoiceFieldModel` with a choice value that exceeds the defined `max_length` for the `choice_field`. The `full_clean` method is used to trigger validation checks. If a `ValidationError` is raised and it is related to the `choice_field`, it prints "Issue resolved". If the instance saves without issues or if other unexpected errors occur, it prints "Issue reproduced" or "Other issues" accordingly.

test_max_length_fits_longest_choice()
```

This test does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules for the Django model and validation.
2. Defines a `SampleModel` class with a `choices` field that includes an option longer than the specified `max_length`.
3. Defines the `test_max_length_fits_longest_choice` function to:
   - Create an instance with a valid choice to ensure no other issues are present.
   - Attempt to create an instance with a choice longer than `max_length` to reproduce the issue.
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is not caught.
   - Print "Issue resolved" if a `ValidationError` is raised, indicating the issue is fixed.
   - Print "Other issues" if any other error is raised during validation.

Run this test to verify the issue and determine if it has been resolved.

This script performs the following actions:
1. Sets up a Django model with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` shorter than one of its choices.
2. Attempts to create and save an instance of this model with the longer choice value.
3. If an `IntegrityError` is raised due to the value being too long, it verifies that the issue is reproduced.
4. If no error is raised or an unexpected error occurs, it handles those cases and prints appropriate messages.

Please ensure you have Django installed and set up correctly in your environment for this script to work as expected.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports necessary modules from Django.
2. **Model Definition**: `SampleModel` is defined with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` of 10 and a set of choices, one of which is too long for the defined `max_length`.
3. **Test Function**: `test_max_length_validation` attempts to create an instance of `SampleModel` with a value that exceeds the `max_length` and calls `full_clean()` to trigger validation.
4. **Outcome Handling**:
    - If a `ValidationError` is raised, it prints "Issue resolved" since the validation is working.
    - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".
    - If no error occurs, it prints "Issue reproduced" indicating that the problem still exists.

By running this test, you can determine if the length check for choices is correctly enforced or if the issue still persists.

In this test:
1. We define a `ChoiceFieldModel` with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` of 10 and a set of choices, one of which exceeds the maximum length.
2. The `test_max_length_for_choices` method attempts to create an instance of this model using the longest choice.
3. If a `ValidationError` specifically related to the maximum length is caught, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. If any other exceptions are caught, it prints "Other issues".
5. If the instance is saved without any issues, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating the problem described in the issue text is indeed present.

Explanation:
- The `ExampleModel` class is defined with a `status` field that has a max length of 10 characters and a set of choices.
- The `TestMaxLenValidation` class inherits from `TestCase` and contains a single test method `test_max_length_with_choices`.
- The test attempts to create an `ExampleModel` instance with a choice that exceeds the defined `max_length`.
- If an `IntegrityError` is raised, it implies the issue has been resolved because the database constraint prevented the save operation.
- If the instance is saved successfully without error, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating the issue exists.
- Any other exceptions are caught and printed as "Other issues".

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
    - `models` from `django.db` to define the model.
    - `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions` to handle validation errors.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - Define a `TestModel` with a `CharField` that has `max_length` set to 6 and `choices` that contains a value longer than 6 characters (`'longer_value'`).

3. **Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced**:
    - Attempt to create an instance of `TestModel` with a status value `'longer_value'` and call `full_clean()` to trigger validation.
    - Catch the `ValidationError` and check if it contains a validation message for the `status` field.

4. **Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved**:
    - If no validation error is raised, print "Issue resolved".

5. **Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code**:
    - If a `ValidationError` is raised but does not contain a message related to the `status` field, print "Other issues".

You can run this test in your Django environment to check if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports necessary modules from Django.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The script defines a `SampleModel` with a `CharField` having max_length of 6 and two choices, one of which is longer than 6 characters.
3. **Outcome Messages**: The script attempts to create and validate an instance of `SampleModel`. If a `ValidationError` is raised indicating that the max_length was exceeded, it prints "Issue resolved". If no error occurs or a different error is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced" or "Other issues" respectively.
4. **Testing Both Reproduction and Resolution**: This test can be used to verify if the problem has been fixed (by ensuring an appropriate validation check is in place).

2. Attempts to create and save a record with a choice that exceeds the `max_length`.
3. Catches a `ValidationError` if the issue is resolved.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if an `IntegrityError` is raised when attempting to save the record.
5. Prints "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised or if no exception is raised, indicating unexpected behavior.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The imports include `models` from `django.db` for creating the test model and handling exceptions related to database integrity.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: A `TestModel` is created with a `CharField` that has `max_length=10` and two choices, one of which is longer than 10 characters. An attempt is made to save an instance using the longer choice to trigger the issue.
3. **Outcome checks**: If the exception raised is due to the value being too long, the issue is reproduced. If no exception is raised, or an unknown exception occurs, appropriate messages are printed.
4. **Print statements**: Based on the outcome, the test prints whether the issue was reproduced, resolved, or if other issues were encountered.

This test ensures that once the issue is fixed (for example, by adding a validation check or increasing `max_length`), the test will print "Issue resolved". If the issue persists, it will print "Issue reproduced". If any other unexpected issues occur, it will print "Other issues".

If the `ValidationError` is not raised, it will print "Issue resolved". Any other exceptions or issues will result in printing "Other issues". 

This setup should help in both reproducing the issue and verifying that it has been resolved.

            print("Other issues")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import `ValidationError` and `models` from Django, and `unittest` for testing.
2. **Reproduce the issue**: We define a `ChoiceModel` with a `status` field where `max_length` is set to 6. One of the choices ('veryverylong') exceeds this length.
3. **Print appropriate messages**: We attempt to validate the model instance. If a `ValidationError` is raised due to the length issue, we print "Issue resolved". If the error is not due to the length issue, or if any other exception occurs, we print "Other issues". If no exception is raised, we print "Issue reproduced".

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify whether it has been resolved.

def test_max_length_with_choices():
    class SampleModel(models.Model):
        CHOICES = [
            ('short', 'Short'),
            ('much_longer_than_max_length', 'Much Longer'),
        ]
        field_with_choices = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=CHOICES)

    except ValidationError:
        print("Issue resolved")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues:", str(e))

test_max_length_with_choices()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
    - `from django.db import models`: To define Django models within the test.
    - `from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError`: To handle validation exceptions.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - Defines a `SampleModel` with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` of 10 but includes a choice that exceeds this length.
    - Attempts to create an instance of `SampleModel` with a value that exceeds the `max_length` for the `field_with_choices`.

3. **Outcome messages**:
    - If a `ValidationError` is raised because the value exceeds `max_length`, it prints "Issue resolved", indicating the check is in place and functional.
    - If the instance is created without any issues, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating the issue is present.
    - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

### Usage:
This test can be used directly in a Django project to verify if the described issue regarding `max_length` and `choices` in Django models is present and to confirm when the issue is fixed.

Certainly! Below is the complete test code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text. This test checks whether the `max_length` of a model field is sufficient to accommodate the longest value in its choices.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

# Define a model with a max_length constraint and choices
class MyModel(models.Model):
    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('short', 'Short'),
        ('longer_value', 'Longer Value'),  # This value is longer than max_length
    ]
    status = models.CharField(max_length=5, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)  # max_length is too short

def test_max_length_fits_longest_choice():
    # Attempt to save an instance with the longest choice to see if it raises an error
    try:
        instance = MyModel(status='longer_value')
        instance.full_clean()  # This should raise a ValidationError
        instance.save()
        print("Issue reproduced")
    except ValidationError as e:
        if 'status' in e.message_dict:
            print("Issue resolved")
        else:
            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

# Run the test
test_max_length_fits_longest_choice()
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports necessary Django modules and classes.
2. Defines a `MyModel` class with a `status` field having `max_length=5` and a choice ('longer_value') that exceeds this length.
3. The `test_max_length_fits_longest_choice` function attempts to create an instance of `MyModel` with the longer choice, calls `full_clean` to run Django's validation (which should raise a `ValidationError`), and attempts to save it.
4. If the `ValidationError` is caught and it contains an error related to the `status` field, it prints "Issue resolved". If the error is different, it prints "Other issues".
5. If no error is raised during the creation and saving of the instance, it prints "Issue reproduced".

This test can be used to reproduce the problem (if no validation error is raised) and to verify the issue has been fixed (if a validation error specific to the `status` field is raised).

Ensure you have Django and a configured project to run the above test. This script attempts to create instances of `SampleModel` with choices that are too long for the defined `max_length`. If the `ValidationError` containing "value too long" is raised, it indicates the issue is reproduced. If no error is raised for an invalid choice, it means the issue is resolved. If any other unexpected issues occur, it will print "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. The `TestModel` class is defined with a `CharField` that has a `max_length` of 10 but includes choices where some exceed this length.
2. The `test_field_max_length` function attempts to create an instance of `TestModel` with a choice that exceeds the `max_length`.
3. If an `IntegrityError` is raised, it indicates that the issue has been reproduced.
4. Any other exception is caught and "Other issues" is printed.
5. If no exception is raised, "Issue resolved" is printed, indicating that the max_length fits the longest choice or that the check is already implemented.

This test script should help in reproducing the described issue and verifying if it has been resolved.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports `models` from `django.db` and `ValidationError` from `django.core.exceptions`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - A Django model `TestModel` is defined with `status` as a `CharField`. The `max_length` is set to 5, and it has choices with one option being much longer than 5 characters.
    - The test function `test_max_length_with_choices` attempts to create instances of `TestModel` with different values for `status`.
3. **Print statements**:
    - If the `ValidationError` is raised due to the length being too long, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If `ValidationError` or any other exception is raised for reasons other than the length, it prints "Other issues".
    - If no exception is raised at all, it prints "Issue resolved".

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Defines a Django model `TestModel` with a `CharField` having a max_length that is too small for one of the choices.
3. **Print statements for different outcomes**:
   - "Issue reproduced" if a `ValidationError` or `IntegrityError` is correctly raised.
   - "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised (indicating the issue is fixed).
   - "Other issues" if other types of exceptions are raised.
4. **Running the test**: The `test_max_length_fits_longest_choice` function is invoked when the script is run directly, which will print the appropriate message based on the outcome.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: We import `models` from `django.db` and `IntegrityError` to catch possible database exceptions. We also import `pytest` for testing.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: We create a sample Django model `SampleModel` with a `status` field that has a `max_length` of 5, which is intentionally set too short for one of the choices.
3. **Print Statements**: We use print statements to check if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.
4. **Testing**: The first test case is for a short label that fits within the `max_length`. The second test case is for a longer label that exceeds the `max_length`.

Please ensure Django is properly configured with a database before running this test. This script is meant to be run as a standalone script.

To use this test:
1. Add the `SampleModel` to your models in your Django application.
2. Run the test via `pytest` to see the output. Adjust the `max_length` or choices as needed to resolve the issue.

The test function attempts to create and save an instance of this model with the longer choice, which should fail and reproduce the issue. If the issue is fixed, a `ValidationError` should be raised indicating that the value does not fit within the specified `max_length`.
