--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
SimpleLazyObject doesn't implement __radd__
Description
	
Technically, there's a whole bunch of magic methods it doesn't implement, compared to a complete proxy implementation, like that of wrapt.ObjectProxy, but __radd__ being missing is the one that's biting me at the moment.
As far as I can tell, the implementation can't just be
__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.radd)
because that doesn't exist, which is rubbish.
__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.attrgetter("__radd__"))
also won't work because types may not have that attr, and attrgetter doesn't supress the exception (correctly)
The minimal implementation I've found that works for me is:
	def __radd__(self, other):
		if self._wrapped is empty:
			self._setup()
		return other + self._wrapped

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])

This test script sets up a scenario where a `SimpleLazyObject` is wrapped around a `MockObject` that implements the `__radd__` method. The test then attempts to add an integer to the `SimpleLazyObject`. If the `__radd__` method is not implemented, a `TypeError` is expected, indicating that the issue is reproduced. If the addition works correctly, it prints "Issue resolved". Any other exceptions will print "Other issues".

# Run the test
test_simple_lazy_object_radd()
```

In this test:
1. We import `SimpleLazyObject` from Django.
2. We define a mock class to simulate the behavior of `SimpleLazyObject`.
3. The `_setup` method and `empty` constant are mocked to facilitate the test.
4. We attempt to perform the reverse addition operation (`5 + lazy_obj`).
5. Based on the outcome, we print the appropriate message.

This test will help identify if the `__radd__` method is missing and will reproduce the issue accordingly. If the issue is fixed, it will print "Issue resolved". If any other issue arises, it will print "Other issues".

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports:** 
   - The `operator` module is imported to show where the `operator.radd` reference comes from (although not used directly here).

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - A `SimpleLazyObject` class is defined to simulate the behavior described in the issue. It includes a `_setup()` method to initialize the wrapped object and a `__radd__` method to perform reversed addition.
   - The `__getattr__` method is used to delegate attribute access to the wrapped object after lazy initialization.

3. **Testing the Issue:**
   - The `test_simple_lazy_object_radd` function is defined to test if the issue can be reproduced or resolved.
   - A `lazy_setup` function is provided to initialize the `SimpleLazyObject` with a value of `5`.
   - If adding `10` to the `SimpleLazyObject` results in `15`, it prints "Issue resolved". Otherwise, it catches and prints "Issue reproduced" or handles other exceptions.

3. The `test_radd_issue` function reproduces the issue by attempting to add an integer to `MySimpleLazyObject`, expected to raise a TypeError due to the absence of `__radd__`.
4. The `test_radd_fixed` function verifies the issue is resolved by using `MyExtendedSimpleLazyObject` and checking if the addition works as expected.

Running these tests should help confirm the presence and resolution of the issue.

test_simplelazyobject_radd()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: 
    - Imported `SimpleLazyObject` from `django.utils.functional`.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - Created a `TestObject` class with an `__radd__` method to simulate the behavior expected in the issue description.
    - Defined a `simple_lazy_object` function that returns a `SimpleLazyObject` wrapping the `TestObject`.

3. **Print Statements**:
    - If the `TypeError` occurs (indicating `__radd__` is not implemented), it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If no exception occurs and the addition works as expected, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues" with the exception message.

The test function `test_simplelazyobject_radd` should be able to help diagnose whether the `SimpleLazyObject` issue with `__radd__` is reproduced or resolved.

test_simple_lazy_object_radd()
```

Explanation:
1. **Imports and Setup**: The necessary imports from `django.utils.functional` and creation of a `SimpleLazyObject` subclass to simulate behavior.
2. **Mock Setup**: Functions and classes to mock the lazy setup process.
3. **Test Function**: The test function `test_simple_lazy_object_radd` which attempts to reproduce the issue by performing a reverse addition operation (`__radd__`). If it fails with a `TypeError`, it prints "Issue reproduced". If it succeeds, it prints "Issue resolved". Any other exceptions are caught and print "Other issues".

This test will help verify both the existence of the issue and its resolution by checking the presence and proper implementation of the `__radd__` method.

This script does the following:
1. Defines a `MyLazyObject` class inheriting from `SimpleLazyObject`.
2. Attempts to reproduce the issue by trying to add an integer to a `SimpleLazyObject` instance.
3. If a `TypeError` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced". If not, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. Then defines a `PatchedLazyObject` class which includes a fix by implementing the `__radd__` method.
5. Attempts to add an integer to an instance of `PatchedLazyObject` and checks if the result is correct.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if the addition works as expected, otherwise prints "Other issues".

This test script ensures that the issue can be reproduced and also verifies if a patch resolves the issue.

Here's a brief breakdown of the code:
1. **Imports:** It imports necessary modules including `SimpleLazyObject` from Django.
2. **Mock Function:** It defines a mock function `lazy_initializer` to serve as the initializer for the lazy object.
3. **Custom Class:** It defines a custom class `CustomSimpleLazyObject` that extends `SimpleLazyObject` and implements the `__radd__` method as suggested in the issue text.
4. **Test Function:** It defines a test function `test_simple_lazy_object_radd` which creates an instance of `CustomSimpleLazyObject`, performs reverse addition, and checks the result.
5. **Output Messages:** Depending on the outcome, it prints "Issue resolved", "Issue reproduced", or "Other issues".

You can use this test to reproduce and verify the issue.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Imports:** We import necessary modules, `SimpleLazyObject` from `django.utils.functional` and `operator`.
2. **MyObject Class:** A basic class `MyObject` with an `__radd__` method that performs the addition.
3. **setup_function:** A mock function that returns an instance of `MyObject`.
4. **SimpleLazyObject Creation:** We create a `SimpleLazyObject` instance that lazy-loads an instance of `MyObject`.
5. **Test Function:** The `test_simple_lazy_object_radd` function tries to add an integer to the `SimpleLazyObject` instance and prints the result based on whether the addition is successful or not. 

Running this test will help you determine if the `__radd__` method is correctly handled by `SimpleLazyObject`. If the issue is reproduced, it means the current implementation is lacking the `__radd__` method. If resolved, the method is correctly called, and the issue should not be present.

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The necessary imports are included at the beginning (`SimpleLazyObject` and `operator` from the standard library).
2. **MockObject:** A `MockObject` class is created to simulate an object that can be wrapped by `SimpleLazyObject`.
3. **ExtendedSimpleLazyObject:** The `SimpleLazyObject` class is extended to include the `__radd__` method as described in the issue description.
4. **Test Function:** A test function `test_simple_lazy_object_radd` is defined to:
   - Create an instance of the extended `SimpleLazyObject`.
   - Perform the reverse addition operation.
   - Print "Issue resolved" if the result matches the expected value.
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if the result does not match the expected value.
   - Print "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised.

In the script above:

1. **Necessary Imports**: We have imported `operator` and `functools.partial` for completeness (although `partial` is not utilized directly in this minimal example).
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - `SimpleLazyObject` class is defined with a minimal implementation, including the `__radd__` method.
   - The `new_method_proxy` function simulates the behavior of method proxying.
3. **Print Statements**:
   - `"Issue reproduced"`: Printed if a `TypeError` occurs, which indicates that the `__radd__` method is missing or incorrectly implemented.
   - `"Issue resolved"`: Printed if the concatenation `"hello" + lazy_obj` works correctly.
   - `"Other issues"`: Printed if any other exceptions occur.

The test case `test_simple_lazy_object_radd` functionally checks if the `__radd__` method is correctly implemented by attempting to concatenate a string with an instance of `SimpleLazyObject`. This should help you verify whether the issue is reproduced or resolved.

Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The necessary `operator` module is imported.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**:
    - `SimpleLazyObject` class is defined.
    - A sentinel `empty` class used to check if the object is uninitialized.
    - `__radd__` method is implemented within `SimpleLazyObject` to showcase the issue.
    - The `setup_func` is defined to return a dummy string "lazy_value".
3. **Test Function**:
    - An instance of `SimpleLazyObject` is created with `setup_func`.
    - An attempt to reproduce the issue by performing reverse addition with a string.
    - The different outcomes are checked:
        - If a `TypeError` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
        - If the result is as expected (`"prefix_lazy_value"`), it prints "Issue resolved".
        - Any other result will print "Other issues".

This test script should help you verify if `SimpleLazyObject` has the `__radd__` issue and if any provided fix resolves it.

2. Defines a custom `Empty` class to represent an uninitialized state.
3. Subclasses `SimpleLazyObject` to create `CustomSimpleLazyObject` to simulate the missing `__radd__` method.
4. Defines a lazy function `lazy_func` that will be wrapped.
5. Implements the `test_simplelazyobject_radd` function to reproduce the issue by attempting to use `__radd__` and catch the expected `TypeError`.
6. It prints "Issue resolved" if the `__radd__` method works correctly, "Issue reproduced" if the expected `TypeError` occurs, and "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

Run the test to see if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

This test script creates a `SimpleLazyObject` subclass, `MyLazyObject`, and sets up a scenario to reproduce the issue with the missing `__radd__`. The script attempts to add a string to an instance of `MyLazyObject` and checks for the appropriate behavior. 

- If a `TypeError` is raised, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
- If the concatenation works and the result is as expected, it indicates the issue is resolved.
- Any other exceptions or unexpected outcomes are flagged as "Other issues."

test_simple_lazy_object_radd()
```

Explanation of the generated test:
1. **Necessary imports**: Imported `operator` and `SimpleLazyObject` from `django.utils.functional`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: A mock implementation of `SimpleLazyObject` was created, and a `__radd__` method was added directly to it.
3. **Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced**: This happens if a `TypeError` is raised when attempting the `__radd__` operation.
4. **Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved**: This happens if the result matches the expected string concatenation.
5. **Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code**: This happens if an unexpected exception is raised or if the result doesn't match the expected output.

This test should be able to help you both reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports `SimpleLazyObject` from `django.utils.functional`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A `TestLazyObject` class is created with a `__radd__` method.
   - A `SimpleLazyObject` is created, wrapping a `TestLazyObject` instance.
3. **Check and Print**:
   - Attempts to add 10 to the `SimpleLazyObject`.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if no error occurs.
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if a `TypeError` related to `__radd__` is caught.
   - Prints "Other issues" if any other exceptions are encountered.

This test should help in identifying if the `__radd__` method is properly implemented or not.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports**: We import `SimpleLazyObject` from `django.utils.functional` and `operator` to simulate the environment and requirements mentioned in the issue.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: We create a subclass `LazyWrapper` of `SimpleLazyObject` that contains the custom `__radd__` method as provided in the issue.
3. **Print Statements**: 
   - If the custom `__radd__` method works correctly, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If a `TypeError` related to the missing `__radd__` method is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - For other unexpected exceptions, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Execution**: The test creates a `LazyWrapper` instance and tries to add it to an integer to trigger the `__radd__` method.

Sure, let's create a complete test to reproduce the issue where `__radd__` is not implemented in `SimpleLazyObject`. To address this, we'll need to simulate a `SimpleLazyObject` and attempt to use the `+` operator in reverse, which should invoke `__radd__`.

        result = 5 + lazy_obj
        
        # Check if the addition result is as expected
        assert result == 15
        print("Issue resolved")

        # If TypeError is raised, then __radd__ is not implemented correctly
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other unexpected exceptions
        print("Other issues")
        return

test_simple_lazy_object_radd()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - `from django.utils.functional import SimpleLazyObject`: Imports the SimpleLazyObject class.
   - `import operator`: Although not used directly, this import represents the context in which `operator.radd` was mentioned in the issue.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A mock implementation of `SimpleLazyObject` is used to simulate the behavior and highlight the `__radd__` issue.
   - The `__radd__` method is implemented within the mock class based on the provided minimal implementation.
   - A test function `test_simple_lazy_object_radd` is created to validate the behavior.

3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the `__radd__` method works correctly and the result is as expected, it prints "Issue resolved."
   - If a `TypeError` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced."
   - Any other exceptions result in "Other issues" being printed.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue before the fix and verify the solution after implementing the fix.
