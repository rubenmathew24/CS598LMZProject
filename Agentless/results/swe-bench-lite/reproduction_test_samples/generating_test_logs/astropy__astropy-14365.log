ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case
### Description

ascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be "READ SERR 1 2" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use "read serr 1 2". 

As many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.

### Expected behavior

The following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.
```
read serr 1 2 
1 0.5 1 0.5
```

### How to Reproduce

Create a QDP file:
```
> cat > test.qdp
read serr 1 2 
1 0.5 1 0.5
<EOF>

 > python
Python 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from astropy.table import Table
>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')
WARNING: table_id not specified. Reading the first available table [astropy.io.ascii.qdp]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    raise ValueError(f'Unrecognized QDP line: {line}')
ValueError: Unrecognized QDP line: read serr 1 2
```

Running "qdp test.qdp" works just fine.

```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** Only `Table` from `astropy.table`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:** 
    - A QDP file with a lowercase command is created.
    - The file is attempted to be read using `Table.read` with the format specified as `'ascii.qdp'`.
3. **Outcome handling:** 
    - If the file reads successfully and the errors are read correctly, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If a `ValueError` is raised with 'Unrecognized QDP line', it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - For any other issues, it prints "Other issues".

Here is the complete test code that can be used to reproduce the issue described in the issue text:

```python
from astropy.table import Table

def test_qdp_case_sensitivity():
    # Create a QDP file with lower case commands
    qdp_content = """read serr 1 2 
1 0.5 1 0.5

    with open('test.qdp', 'w') as f:
        f.write(qdp_content)
    
    try:
        # Attempt to read the QDP file into a Table
        table = Table.read('test.qdp', format='ascii.qdp')
        print("Issue resolved")

            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

test_qdp_case_sensitivity()
```

Explanation:
1. The test creates a QDP file `test.qdp` with commands in lower case.
2. The `Table.read` function from `astropy.table` is used to attempt to read the QDP file.
3. If a `ValueError` with the message 'Unrecognized QDP line' is raised, it indicates the described issue is reproduced.
4. If no error is raised and the table is read successfully, it indicates the issue has been resolved.
5. Any other exceptions will print "Other issues", indicating there are other problems with the code.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**:
    - `os` for file operations.
    - `Table` from `astropy.table` to read the QDP file.
    - `NamedTemporaryFile` from `tempfile` to create a temporary QDP file.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - A temporary QDP file is created with the content specified in the issue.
    - The file is read using `Table.read` with the `ascii.qdp` format.
    - The presence of 'y1err' and 'y2err' columns indicates that errors are read correctly.

3. **Outcome Evaluation**:
    - If the QDP file is read without exceptions and error columns are present, the issue is considered resolved.
    - If a `ValueError` with "Unrecognized QDP line" is raised, the issue is reproduced.

test_ascii_qdp_case_sensitivity()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary modules from `astropy` and `numpy` are imported.
2. **QDP File Content**: A string containing the QDP file content with a lower case command (`read serr 1 2`) is defined.
3. **Write QDP File**: The QDP content is written to `test.qdp`.
4. **Read QDP File**: The test attempts to read `test.qdp` using `Table.read` with the `ascii.qdp` format.
5. **Check Read Results**:
   - If the table is read correctly and contains errors, it checks if the appropriate command (`READ SERR` or `read serr`) appears in `table.meta`.
   - Prints "Issue resolved" if the issue is fixed.
   - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific issue is encountered.
   - Prints "Other issues" if there are different errors encountered.

test_ascii_qdp_case_sensitivity()
```

### Explanation:
1. Import the necessary `Table` class from `astropy.table`.
2. Define a function `test_ascii_qdp_case_sensitivity()` to encompass the test.
3. Create a QDP file with lower case commands within the function.
4. Attempt to read the QDP file using `Table.read()` with the specified format `ascii.qdp`.
5. Use try-except blocks to handle the outcomes:
    - If the issue is reproduced (i.e., a `ValueError` with 'Unrecognized QDP line' is raised), print "Issue reproduced".
    - If the issue is resolved (i.e., no exceptions are raised and Table is read correctly), print "Issue resolved".
    - If any other unexpected issues occur, print "Other issues".
6. Call the function to execute the test.

def test_ascii_qdp_case_sensitivity():
    # Step 1: Create the QDP file with lowercase commands
    qdp_content = """read serr 1 2

test_ascii_qdp_case_sensitivity()
```

### Explanation
1. **Necessary Imports**: We import the `Table` class from `astropy.table`.
2. **Create the QDP file**: We write the QDP content to a file `test.qdp` using lower case commands as described in the issue.
3. **Read the QDP file**: We attempt to read the `test.qdp` file using `Table.read()` from `astropy.table` with the `ascii.qdp` format.
4. **Check the Outcome**:
    - If the file reads successfully without raising an error, we print "Issue resolved".
    - If a `ValueError` with the message containing 'Unrecognized QDP line' is raised, we print "Issue reproduced" indicating that the issue still exists.
    - For any other exceptions, we print "Other issues" indicating that there might be other problems that need attention.

This script will help in diagnosing if the case sensitivity issue in the `ascii.qdp` reader has been fixed or not.

This script performs the following actions:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Creates the test QDP file with the content specified in the issue.
3. Attempts to read the QDP file using `astropy.table.Table.read`.
4. Determines whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues based on the exceptions raised.
5. Cleans up by removing the temporary QDP file after the test is done.

This test script completes the following steps:
1. Writes a QDP content with a lowercase command to a file.
2. Attempts to read the QDP file into an `astropy.table.Table`.
3. Checks if the table is read correctly by verifying the first header line.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the table reads correctly with errors.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if a `ValueError` indicating an unrecognized QDP line is raised.
6. Prints "Other issues" if any other exceptions occur.

This test does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Creates a QDP file with a lowercase command.
3. Attempts to read the QDP file using `Table.read`.
4. Checks if the issue is reproduced by catching the specific `ValueError` that indicates the lowercase command was not recognized.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the table is read correctly and matches the expected data.
6. Prints "Other issues" if there are any other exceptions or if the table content does not match the expected data.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary import from `astropy.table`.
2. **File Creation**: The code creates a QDP file with the content described in the issue text.
3. **Test Logic**: Attempts to read the QDP file into an `Astropy` Table.
4. **Outcome Determination**: Checks if the read operation was successful by examining the presence of error metadata (`'err' in table.meta`). 
5. **Printing Results**: Prints "Issue resolved" if the test passes, "Issue reproduced" if the described issue occurs, and "Other issues" if there are different unexpected problems.

2. Defines the test function `test_ascii_qdp_case_sensitivity`.
3. Writes the QDP content to a file named "test.qdp".
4. Attempts to read the QDP file using `Table.read` with the format set to `'ascii.qdp'`.
5. Based on the outcome of the read operation, it prints "Issue resolved" if the table is read successfully, "Issue reproduced" if a specific `ValueError` is raised, or "Other issues" if any other exception occurs.
