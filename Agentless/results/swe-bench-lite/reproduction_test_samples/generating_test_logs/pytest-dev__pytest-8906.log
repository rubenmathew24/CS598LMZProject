--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Improve handling of skip for module level
This is potentially about updating docs, updating error messages or introducing a new API.

Consider the following scenario:

`pos_only.py` is using Python 3,8 syntax:
```python
def foo(a, /, b):
    return a + b
```

It should not be tested under Python 3.6 and 3.7.
This is a proper way to skip the test in Python older than 3.8:
```python
from pytest import raises, skip
import sys
if sys.version_info < (3, 8):
    skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)

# import must be after the module level skip:
from pos_only import *

def test_foo():
    assert foo(10, 20) == 30
    assert foo(10, b=20) == 30
    with raises(TypeError):
        assert foo(a=10, b=20)
```

My actual test involves parameterize and a 3.8 only class, so skipping the test itself is not sufficient because the 3.8 class was used in the parameterization.

A naive user will try to initially skip the module like:

```python
if sys.version_info < (3, 8):
    skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8")
```
This issues this error:

>Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.

The proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).

The correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.

This area feels a bit unpolished.
A few ideas to improve:

1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.
2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module("reason")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.

Explanation:
1. Import necessary modules and functions.
2. Check the Python version and attempt to reproduce the issue by using `skip` without `allow_module_level`.
3. If an error occurs, check if it matches the expected error message.
4. Test the alternative API suggestion (`skip_module`), which is expected to be not implemented yet, and fall back to using `skip` with `allow_module_level`.
5. Attempt to import the Python 3.8 specific module and catch any syntax errors to confirm the issue.
6. Define and run the test function to ensure it behaves as expected.
7. Print appropriate messages based on the outcomes to indicate whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

```

This test script aims to:

1. Import necessary modules.
2. Reproduce the issue by simulating the incorrect usage of `skip` without `allow_module_level` and verifying the specific error message.
3. Verify the correct usage of `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` and ensure the test runs correctly under the appropriate Python version.
4. Print appropriate messages based on the outcomes.

To run this test, make sure you have the `pytest` and `pytest-raises` libraries installed. Adjust the `pos_only` import path as necessary to fit your project structure.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_positional_only_syntax()
```

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The necessary modules `sys` and `pytest` are imported.
2. **Simulate Module Creation:** The script writes a Python module `pos_only.py` with syntax specific to Python 3.8.
3. **Handling Different Python Versions:**
    - If the Python version is less than 3.8, attempting to import `pos_only` should raise a `SyntaxError` due to the unsupported syntax. The script will then print "Issue reproduced".
    - If running with Python 3.8 or above, it imports `foo` from the `pos_only` module and defines a test function `test_foo()` that runs the assertions provided in the issue.
4. **Outcome Messages:** Based on the result of the tests, it will print "Issue resolved" if no issues are found with the 3.8-compatible code or "Other issues" if any unexpected errors occur.

To run this test:
1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `test_issue.py`.
2. Execute the script with Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8+ to observe the different outcomes.

This script ensures that the issue can be reproduced in environments where the syntax is not supported and verifies the solution in environments where it is supported.

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports `sys` for checking the Python version and `pytest` for handling skips and assertions.

2. **Reproducing the issue**:
   - The test checks the Python version. If it's less than 3.8, it attempts to skip the module using `pytest.skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)`.
   - It then tries to import `foo` from a hypothetical `pos_only.py` module, which uses Python 3.8+ specific syntax.

3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the skip is successful and caught as a `pytest.skip.Exception`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the test executes without hitting the skip (i.e., running on Python 3.8 or higher) without errors, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other exception is caught and results in "Other issues".

This test should help in verifying the issue and confirming if the behavior is as expected or if it needs fixing.

In this script:
1. We import the necessary modules (`sys` and `pytest`).
2. We define a test function `test_skip_module_level`.
3. Inside the function, we check if the Python version is less than 3.8. If it is, we attempt to call `pytest.skip` and catch a `pytest.UsageError`. If caught, we print the error and "Issue reproduced".
4. If the Python version is 3.8 or higher, or if the skip was not called properly, we attempt to import the `pos_only` module.
5. If we encounter a `SyntaxError` during import (which is expected for Python < 3.8), we print "Issue resolved".
6. Any other exceptions during import are flagged as "Other issues".

The test will attempt to import `pos_only` and use a function `foo` defined within it.

Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: The `sys`, `raises`, and `skip` functions are imported at the beginning.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The main function `test_module_level_skip` includes a conditional `skip` for Python versions lower than 3.8 and the import statement for `pos_only`. The `test_foo` function is defined and executed within this context to check the functionality.
3. **Outcome Messages**: Based on the exception handling, it checks for the specific error message to print "Issue reproduced". If any other issue arises, it prints "Other issues". If no exceptions are raised, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been fixed.

### Explanation:

1. **Importing necessary modules**: 
   - `sys` for checking the Python version.
   - `pytest` for running the tests and handling skips.
   
2. **Creating a temporary script**:
   - The `create_temp_script` function creates a temporary Python script named `temp_test_script.py` containing the code snippet from the issue description.

3. **Test function**:
   - The `test_issue_reproduction` function writes the temporary script to disk and runs it using `pytest.main`.
   - The result of `pytest.main` is checked against `pytest.ExitCode` to determine whether the issue has been reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

### Running the Test:
1. Save the script to a file and run it to check if the issue is reproduced or resolved.
2. The script will print "Issue reproduced" if the `pytest.skip` error occurs, "Issue resolved" if the test passes, and "Other issues" if any other issues or exceptions occur.

This script should help to verify if the issue described can be reproduced and also to check if any fixes applied resolve the issue.

This test script performs the following steps:

1. Imports the necessary modules (`pytest` and `sys`).
2. Defines a function `test_skip_module_level_reproduction` to reproduce the issue.
3. Simulates the content of the `pos_only.py` file which uses Python 3.8 syntax.
4. Writes the simulated content to a temporary file named `pos_only.py`.
5. Attempts to import the `pos_only` module and handles potential syntax errors for older Python versions.
6. If the Python version is less than 3.8, it attempts to skip the module using `pytest.skip`.
7. If the module is successfully imported, it defines and runs the `test_foo` function.
8. Prints "Issue resolved" if the test runs without issues or the skip is successful.
9. Prints "Issue reproduced" if a `SyntaxError` is encountered.
10. Prints "Other issues" for any other exceptions.
11. Finally, it cleans up the temporary file `pos_only.py`.

2. The test checks the Python version and attempts to skip if the version is less than 3.8.
3. The test imports the `pos_only` module and verifies the behavior as described in the issue.
4. The test captures and prints the appropriate message based on whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

This script will:
1. Create a `pos_only.py` file containing a function with syntax that requires Python 3.8 or newer.
2. Create a `test_pos_only.py` file intended to demonstrate the issue with module-level skipping.
3. Run the test using pytest.
4. Print "Issue reproduced" if the test fails as expected (indicating the issue is reproduced).
5. Print "Issue resolved" if the test passes (indicating the issue is resolved).
6. Print "Other issues" if there are any other unexpected outcomes.
7. Clean up the created files afterward.

Here's the complete test based on the issue description provided. The test intends to reproduce the issue related to module-level skipping in pytest for different Python versions.

            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

test_module_level_skip()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary imports are included (`sys` and `pytest`).
2. **Reproduce the Issue**:
    - The `if sys.version_info < (3, 8): pytest.skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8")` block tries to skip the module if Python version is less than 3.8.
    - This is expected to raise a `pytest.UsageError` because using `pytest.skip` outside of a test function is not allowed in pytest.
    - If the exception message matches the known error about improper use of `pytest.skip`, it will print "Issue reproduced."
3. **Test Execution**:
    - If no `UsageError` occurs, the function will attempt to import `pos_only` and execute `test_foo` to validate the behavior.
    - If the import or test execution proceeds without errors, "Issue resolved" will be printed.
4. **Exception Handling**:
    - Catches `pytest.UsageError` to verify if it's the expected error.
    - Catches any other exceptions and prints "Other issues" for unexpected cases.

This test script is designed to run in an environment where Python 3.8 syntax is used, and it will help confirm whether the issue with the `pytest.skip` function is reproduced or resolved.

2. Attempts to skip the test module if the Python version is less than 3.8 using `skip`.
3. Imports `foo` from `pos_only.py` and defines a test function for it.
4. Calls the test function and prints "Issue resolved" if no exceptions occur.
5. Catches exceptions and checks if they contain the specific error message related to using `pytest.skip` outside of a test, printing "Issue reproduced" if so.
6. Prints "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

Explanation:
1. Necessary imports: `sys`, `raises`, `skip`
2. Code to reproduce the issue: The script attempts to skip the module if the Python version is less than 3.8, using `allow_module_level=True`.
3. If the skip does not work as expected, it will catch a `SyntaxError` and print "Issue reproduced".
4. If everything works correctly, it will run the test and print "Issue resolved".
5. If there are any other issues, they will be printed as "Other issues".

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** All necessary imports are done at the beginning.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:** The code includes a condition to skip the module if the Python version is below 3.8 and attempts to import the module with Python 3.8 syntax.
3. **Print statements to verify the outcome:**
   - If the skip mechanism works correctly, it should print "Issue resolved".
   - If it skips due to the version check, it should print "Issue reproduced".
   - For any other issues encountered, it prints "Other issues".

It attempts to use `pytest.skip` outside of a test function, which should reproduce the issue when running with Python versions less than 3.8. If the skip is executed correctly, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the skip is not executed and the script continues to run, it prints "Issue resolved". Any other exceptions are caught and printed as "Other issues".

You would need a file named `pos_only.py` with the following content to fully test this:

Explanation:
1. We simulate the `pos_only.py` file by writing the provided Python 3.8 syntax code into a file.
2. We run a test function `test_module_level_skip` that tries to reproduce the issue by incorrectly attempting to use `pytest.skip` without the `allow_module_level=True` argument.
3. If the issue is reproduced, we print "Issue reproduced".
4. If other issues arise, we print "Other issues".
5. We then test the correct way to skip the module using `allow_module_level=True` and check if no exceptions are raised.
6. If the correct skip is executed without issues, we print "Issue resolved".

By running this script under different Python versions, you can verify both the reproduction of the issue and the resolution.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `sys`, `pytest`, and necessary modules for the test.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: A temporary `pos_only.py` file is created with Python 3.8-only syntax. The script attempts to skip the test if the Python version is less than 3.8.
3. **Handling the Skip**: The script uses the `pytest.skip` function with `allow_module_level=True` to skip the module level for Python versions less than 3.8.
4. **Testing the Import**: The test tries to import the `foo` function from `pos_only.py`, which should cause a `SyntaxError` in Python versions less than 3.8 if the skip did not work correctly.
5. **Test Function**: The test function `test_foo` checks the functionality of the `foo` function.
6. **Outcome Messages**: The script prints "Issue resolved" if the skip works correctly, "Issue reproduced" if a `SyntaxError` is raised, and "Other issues" for any other errors.
7. **Cleanup**: The script ensures that the temporary `pos_only.py` file is removed after the test.

This script can help verify and reproduce the issue. If the skip functionality works correctly, it will print "Issue resolved"; otherwise, it will print "Issue reproduced" or "Other issues" depending on the outcome.

This script is designed to test the described issue with pytest's module-level skip functionality. First, it attempts to reproduce the issue using an incorrect skip implementation and captures the `UsageError` to confirm the problem. Then, it applies the correct solution to verify if the issue is resolved. The script will print "Issue reproduced" if the issue can be recreated, "Issue resolved" if the proper solution works, and "Other issues" if any other unexpected errors occur.

test_skip_module_level()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: `import pytest` and `import sys`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - It first checks the Python version.
   - If the version is less than 3.8, it skips the module using `pytest.skip("Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)`.
   - It then imports the module and defines a test for the `foo` function.
3. **Print messages**:
   - If the correct skip message is caught, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the error about using `pytest.skip` outside of a test is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - For any other exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

### Usage:
Place this script in your test environment and execute it. The print statements will help verify if the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

        if sys.version_info < (3, 8):
            skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)

        # The following import should not be reached under Python < 3.8
        from pos_only import *

        def test_foo():

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

test_skip_module_under_python_3_7()
```

In this test:

1. We simulate running the test in Python 3.7 by setting `sys.version_info = (3, 7)`.
2. We check if the module is correctly skipped when the Python version is less than 3.8.
3. If a `RuntimeError` occurs with the message about `pytest.skip`, we print "Issue reproduced".
4. If the module skips correctly without errors, we print "Issue resolved".
5. For any other exceptions, we print "Other issues".

This test should be able to both reproduce the issue and verify whether a fix has been applied successfully.

Explanation:
1. Created a test function `test_skip_module` which simulates the described issue.
2. Uses the `skip` function with `allow_module_level=True` to skip the module if the Python version is less than 3.8.
3. Imports the `foo` function from the `pos_only` module after applying the skip logic.
4. Defines a parameterized test function `test_foo` to validate the behavior of `foo`.
5. Handles exceptions to check if the specific error message regarding `pytest.skip` is raised, indicating the issue is reproduced.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exceptions occur, indicating the issue is fixed.
7. Prints "Other issues" if any other error occurs.
8. The script should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue and verify the fix.

Explanation of the code:

1. **Simulated Module Creation**: The test starts by writing a simulated module `pos_only.py` with Python 3.8+ syntax.
2. **Version Check and Skip**: It then checks the Python version and attempts to use `pytest.skip` if the version is less than 3.8.
3. **Import and Test Definition**: If the Python version is sufficient, it imports the `foo` function and defines a test for it.
4. **Test Execution**: It runs the test using `pytest.main()`.
5. **Outcome Messages**: Based on the outcome of the test, it prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues" if any exception occurs.

This test should be able to both reproduce the issue when run with Python versions less than 3.8 and verify the issue has been fixed when the appropriate solution is implemented.

1. Attempts to skip the test using the naive approach described in the issue (`pytest.skip` without `allow_module_level`).
2. If an error is raised by `pytest.skip`, it checks if it is due to the specific rule that prevents using `pytest.skip` outside of a test.
3. If a `SyntaxError` occurs, it confirms that the naive skipping method failed, hence reproducing the issue.
4. If any other exceptions occur, it reports "Other issues".
5. If no errors are encountered, it reports "Issue resolved".

This test script aims to capture the behavior observed in the issue and could be used to verify if the issue persists after implementing any proposed changes.

Explanation:
1. Essential imports: `pytest` and `sys`.
2. The code checks the Python version. If it's less than 3.8, it tries to skip the module with `allow_module_level=True`.
3. The code attempts to import the module `pos_only` that uses Python 3.8 syntax. If this import fails due to `SyntaxError`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If the import is successful and the test runs without issues, it prints "Other issues".
5. If the module is skipped correctly, it prints "Issue resolved".
