We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

test_permutation_constructor_with_non_disjoint_cycles()
```

### Explanation

1. **Necessary Imports**:
    - Replace `from permutation_module import Permutation` with the appropriate import statement for your `Permutation` class/module.
  
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - Attempt to create a `Permutation` instance using non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.
  
3. **Print Statements**:
    - If a `ValueError` is raised, the test prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If no exception is raised, it checks if the permutation created is the identity permutation, and prints "Issue resolved" if it is. If it is not the identity permutation, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test should help you determine whether the issue has been resolved in your `Permutation` class implementation.

In this test:
- We are trying to create a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.
- We then check if the result is the identity permutation, which is represented as an empty list `[]` (assuming this representation is correct in your implementation).
- The test will print "Issue resolved" if the permutation created is indeed the identity permutation.
- The test will print "Issue reproduced" if a `ValueError` is raised or if the result is not the identity permutation.
- It will print "Other issues" if any other exceptions occur.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Adjust the import statement to refer to the actual module where the `Permutation` class is defined.
2. **Test Function**: `test_permutation_constructor_with_non_disjoint_cycles` tries to construct a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0,1]]`.
3. **Exception Handling**:
   - If a `ValueError` is raised, print "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception is raised, print "Other issues" and the exception details.
4. **Identity Check**:
   - If no exception is raised, the function checks if the resulting permutation is the identity permutation using the method `is_identity()`. Adjust this to use the actual method provided by the `Permutation` class to check if it's the identity permutation.
   - If the permutation is the identity permutation, print "Issue resolved".
   - If the permutation is not the identity permutation, print "Issue reproduced".

This test helps in reproducing the issue as well as verifying whether the issue has been resolved after a potential fix.

In this test:
1. The necessary import is `from your_module import Permutation`. Replace `your_module` with the actual module name where `Permutation` is defined.
2. The `test_permutation_non_disjoint_cycles` function attempts to construct a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles.
3. If the constructor raises a `ValueError`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If the `Permutation` is constructed successfully and represents the identity permutation, it prints "Issue resolved".
5. If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues" and the details of the exception.

Make sure to adjust the import statement according to your actual module structure.

2. Attempts to create a `Permutation` with non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.
3. If a `ValueError` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If no exception is raised, it checks if the resulting permutation is the identity permutation by applying it to the elements `0` and `1`.
5. If the permutation is the identity permutation, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".

4. If no `ValueError` is raised and the resulting permutation is correctly identified as the identity permutation, we print "Issue resolved".
5. If the permutation produced does not match the identity permutation, we print "Other issues".

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been fixed. Adjust the import statement and identity check according to the actual implementation details of the `Permutation` class in your repository.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** The test assumes an existing `Permutation` class which should be imported from the relevant module. Adjust the import statement based on the actual module name.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:** The test creates a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.
3. **Outcome Validation:**
    - If the constructed permutation maps `0` to `0` and `1` to `1`, print "Issue resolved".
    - If the construction raises a `ValueError`, indicating the issue has been reproduced, print "Issue reproduced".
    - Catch other unexpected exceptions and print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure the permutation class is correctly designed to allow for these tests. Here, a simple implementation of the `Permutation` class is shown, assuming `permutation_module` as the module name. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual implementation and module structure.

test_permutation_constructor_with_non_disjoint_cycles()

Please note:
1. The implementation assumes that there is a `Permutation` class in a module named `permutation_module`.
2. It also assumes the existence of a method `identity_permutation` to create the identity permutation for comparison.
3. Modify the imports and method calls as necessary to match your actual implementation.

Notes:
- Replace `some_module` with the actual module where the `Permutation` class is defined.
- The `to_list()` method is assumed to exist and return the permutation as a list. Modify it if your actual `Permutation` class uses a different method to represent the permutation.
- The identity permutation is assumed to be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. Modify it based on your actual identity permutation representation.

Certainly! Below is a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue described in your issue text. This test checks if the `Permutation` constructor properly handles non-disjoint cycles and outputs appropriate messages based on the results.

```python
# Necessary imports
from your_module import Permutation  # Replace `your_module` with the actual module name where Permutation is defined

def test_permutation_non_disjoint_cycles() -> None:
    try:
        # Code to reproduce the issue
        perm = Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])  # This should not raise a ValueError

        # Checking if the result is the identity permutation
        # Assuming the identity permutation means elements map to themselves
        identity = list(range(len(perm)))
        if all(perm[i] == identity[i] for i in identity):
            print("Issue resolved")
        else:
            print("Issue reproduced")
    except ValueError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_permutation_non_disjoint_cycles()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** The test imports the `Permutation` class from your module. Replace `your_module` with the actual module name.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:** The test attempts to create a `Permutation` object with the non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.
3. **Outcome checks:**
   - If a `ValueError` is raised, the test prints "Issue reproduced."
   - It checks if the resulting permutation is the identity permutation (elements map to themselves). If it is, the test prints "Issue resolved."
   - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if the issue has been fixed.

Sure, here is the generated test code that you can use to reproduce the issue described in the issue text and verify if it has been resolved:

```python
from your_module import Permutation

def test_permutation_non_disjoint_cycles():
    try:
        # Initialize Permutation with non-disjoint cycles
        p = Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])
    except ValueError:
        # If the code raises a ValueError, the issue is reproduced
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return
    except Exception:
        # If any other exception is raised, there are other issues
        print("Other issues")
        return

    # Check if the outcome is the identity permutation
    try:
        identity_permutation = list(range(len(p)))  # Assuming Permutation class supports len() and indexing
        assert all(p[i] == identity_permutation[i] for i in range(len(p)))
        print("Issue resolved")
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
    except Exception:
        print("Other issues")

test_permutation_non_disjoint_cycles()
```

Make sure to replace `your_module` with the actual name of the module where the `Permutation` class is defined. This test will try to construct a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`. If a `ValueError` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the resulting permutation is the identity permutation, it prints "Issue resolved". If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".

```

Some notes:
1. The `Permutation` class should be imported from its actual module.
2. The `to_list()` method or equivalent should be replaced with the correct method to retrieve the permutation representation from the `Permutation` instance.
3. The test assumes that the identity permutation for a list of two elements is `[0, 1]`. Adjust this based on the specifics of the implementation.

```

In this test:
1. We import the `Permutation` class from the module `permutations`.
2. We attempt to create a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]`.
3. We check if the resulting permutation is the identity permutation by comparing it to a list representing the identity permutation.
4. If a `ValueError` is raised, we print "Issue reproduced".
5. If the permutation is correctly constructed and matches the identity permutation, we print "Issue resolved".
6. If any other exception is raised, we print "Other issues" and the unexpected error message.
