Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Attempts to create a plot using boolean values for the color mapping, which is expected to fail based on the issue description.
3. Catches the specific `TypeError` mentioned in the issue text to confirm that the issue is reproduced.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific error is caught.
5. Prints "Other issues" if a different error is caught or no exception occurs.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception occurs, indicating the issue has been fixed.

3. Attempts to create a plot using boolean values for the `color` parameter which is expected to fail.
4. Categorizes the outcome:
    - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific `TypeError` related to boolean subtraction is encountered.
    - Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised, indicating the issue has been fixed.
    - Prints "Other issues" if any other exception is raised, suggesting a different problem.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** `seaborn.objects as so` to import the plotting functionality.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:** The problematic code snippet from the issue text is directly used.
3. **Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced:** If the specific `TypeError` related to boolean subtraction is caught.
4. **Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved:** If no exception is raised.
5. **Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code:** If any other exception is raised, or if the `TypeError` has a different message.

```

This test script:
1. Imports the necessary `seaborn.objects` module.
2. Defines the function `test_color_mapping_with_boolean_data` to reproduce and verify the fix of the issue.
3. Attempts to create and show a plot using boolean data for the `color` argument.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception occurs (indicating the issue may have been fixed).
5. Catches the specific `TypeError` and checks if it matches the error described, printing "Issue reproduced" if it does.
6. Catches any other exceptions and prints "Other issues" to indicate unexpected problems.

   - "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised (indicating the issue may have been fixed).
   - "Issue reproduced" if the specific `TypeError` exception is raised.
   - "Other issues" if a different exception is raised.

This test script:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Defines a test function that attempts to reproduce the issue using the provided code snippet.
3. Catches and checks for the specific `TypeError` mentioned in the issue.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the specific `TypeError` is caught.
5. Prints "Other issues" if a different exception is caught.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if no exception is raised.

This will help in verifying whether the issue has been resolved or if there are any other issues with the source code.
