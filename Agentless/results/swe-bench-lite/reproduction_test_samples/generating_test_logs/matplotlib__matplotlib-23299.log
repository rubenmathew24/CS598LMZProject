[Bug]: get_backend() clears figures from Gcf.figs if they were created under rc_context
### Bug summary

calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the *first* figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`.

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import get_backend, rc_context

# fig1 = plt.figure()  # <- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL WORK
# plt.ion()            # <- ALTERNATIVELY, UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL ALSO WORK
with rc_context():
    fig2 = plt.figure()
before = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'
get_backend()
after = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'

assert before == after, '\n' + before + '\n' + after
```


### Actual outcome

```

94453354309744 OrderedDict()
```

### Expected outcome

The figure should not be missing from `Gcf`.  Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python

    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),

If no `AssertionError` is raised, we print "Issue resolved".\n9. We also handle any other exceptions that may arise and print "Other issues" with the exception message.\n10.

In this test script:
1. Necessary imports are included.
2. The code to reproduce the issue is provided within the function `test_figures_cleared_with_get_backend`.
3. It prints "Issue reproduced" if the figures are cleared from Gcf after calling `get_backend()`.
4. It prints "Issue resolved" if the figures persist in Gcf after calling `get_backend()`.
5. It prints "Other issues" if there is an exception or any other unexpected behavior.

This test can be used to verify whether the described issue occurs and whether it is resolved after fixing the underlying problem.

Explanation:
1. We import the necessary modules: `matplotlib.pyplot`, `get_backend`, and `rc_context`.
2. We define a function `test_matplotlib_backend_issue` to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Inside the function, we create a figure within an `rc_context`.
4. We capture the state of `Gcf.figs` before calling `get_backend`.
5. We call `get_backend` to potentially trigger the issue.
6. We capture the state after calling `get_backend`.
7. We compare the states before and after calling `get_backend`. If they differ, we print "Issue reproduced".
8. If no `AssertionError` is raised, we print "Issue resolved".
9. We also handle any other exceptions that may arise and print "Other issues" with the exception message.
10. Finally, we call the test function to execute the test.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules and functions.
2. Creates a figure within an `rc_context`.
3. Captures the state of `Gcf` before and after calling `get_backend`.
4. Compares the states and prints the appropriate message based on the result:
    - "Issue resolved" if the problem is fixed.
    - "Issue reproduced" if the problem persists.
    - "Other issues" if there are different types of errors encountered.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules.
2. Creates a figure within an `rc_context`.
3. Captures the state of `Gcf.figs` before and after calling `get_backend()`.
4. Asserts that the state of `Gcf.figs` remains unchanged, and prints appropriate messages based on the outcome.

This should help in both reproducing the issue and verifying if it has been resolved.

4. Captures the initial state of `Gcf.figs`.
5. Calls `get_backend()` which is suspected to alter the state of `Gcf.figs`.
6. Captures the state of `Gcf.figs` again.
7. Checks if the state has changed. If it has changed, it prints "Issue reproduced".
8. If the state has not changed, it prints "Issue resolved".
9. If any other exception occurs during the test, it prints "Other issues".

This should allow you to reproduce and verify the issue in your repository.

```

This test script is designed to:

1. Import the necessary modules.
2. Create a figure within an `rc_context`.
3. Capture the state of `plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf` before calling `get_backend`.
4. Call the `get_backend` function.
5. Capture the state of `plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf` after calling `get_backend`.
6. Compare the states before and after the call to `get_backend`.

Depending on the outcome, the script will print:
- "Issue reproduced" if the state of `Gcf` changes, indicating the issue is still present.
- "Issue resolved" if the state of `Gcf` remains unchanged, indicating the issue has been resolved.
- "Other issues" if any other exceptions occur during the execution of the test.

This test script includes the necessary steps to reproduce the issue described in the provided issue text. The code:
1. Creates a figure within an `rc_context`.
2. Captures the state of the `Gcf` object before calling `get_backend()`.
3. Calls `get_backend()`.
4. Captures the state of the `Gcf` object after calling `get_backend()`.
5. Compares the state before and after calling `get_backend()` to determine if the issue has been reproduced, resolved, or if other issues are present.

When running this test, it will print "Issue reproduced" if the figures are cleared, "Issue resolved" if the figures are not cleared, and "Other issues" if there are any exceptions.

This test script follows the requested format and should help determine if the issue described persists, as well as verify if it has been resolved in the future. The script will print "Issue resolved" if the figures remain unchanged, "Issue reproduced" if the figures are cleared, and "Other issues" if any other exceptions occur.

This script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Sets up the scenario to reproduce the issue by creating a figure within an `rc_context`.
3. Captures the state of `Gcf.figs` before and after calling `get_backend()`.
4. Asserts that the state of `Gcf.figs` remains unchanged.
5. If the assertion fails, it prints "Issue reproduced". If the assertion passes, it prints "Issue resolved".
6. If there are any other exceptions, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.
