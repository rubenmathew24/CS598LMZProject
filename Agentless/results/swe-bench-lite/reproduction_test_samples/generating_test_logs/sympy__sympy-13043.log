We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
decompose() function in intpoly returns a list of arbitrary order
The decompose() function, with separate=True, returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which is ordered arbitrarily.  

What is this used for? It should be sorted somehow, or returning a set (in which case, why not just use the returned dictionary and have the caller take the values). This is causing test failures for me after some changes to the core.

Explanation:
1. The test imports the `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.
2. It creates a sample polynomial dictionary `poly_dict` for testing.
3. It calls the `decompose` function with `poly_dict` and `separate=True`.
4. It compares the result to the expected unordered list (`list(poly_dict.values())`).
5. If the order is arbitrary, it prints "Issue reproduced".
6. If the issue is resolved, it prints "Issue resolved".
7. If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.

This test can be used to check if the issue is reproduced or resolved after changes.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import the `decompose` function from the assumed module `intpoly`. Adjust the import if the actual module is different.
2. **Test Function**:
   - We define a test polynomial dictionary `poly_dict` to simulate the input to the `decompose` function.
   - The `decompose` function is called with `separate=True`.
   - The test checks if the result is sorted. If it is already sorted, it prints "Issue resolved"; otherwise, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - Any exceptions encountered during execution will print "Other issues" along with the exception details.
3. **Execution**: The test function `test_decompose_order()` is called to execute the test.

This test will help verify if the `decompose` function's output is the cause of the arbitrary order issue and will also confirm if the issue has been resolved.

### Explanation
1. **Necessary Imports:** Import the `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.
2. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Define a sample polynomial dictionary (`poly_dict`).
   - Call the `decompose` function with `separate=True`.
3. **Outcome Handling:**
   - Compare the result of the `decompose` function with the sorted values of the polynomial dictionary.
   - Print "Issue resolved" if the result is sorted as expected.
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if the result is out of order but contains the same elements as the sorted values.
   - Print "Other issues" if the result does not match the expected elements.

This test should help to identify if the `decompose` function's output is indeed ordered arbitrarily, and it will also serve to verify if the issue has been fixed.

    poly_dict = OrderedDict({
        'a': 1,

        'c': 3,
        'd': 4,

    except Exception as e:

# Run the test function

This script should effectively reproduce the issue as it calls the `decompose` function with a dictionary whose items have been shuffled to be in an arbitrary order. If the function returns the values in an unexpected order, it will print "Issue reproduced". If it returns the values in the expected order, it will print "Issue resolved". If there are any other issues, it will catch the exception and print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

You can use this script to verify whether the issue persists or has been resolved in your repository.

4. Calls the `decompose` function with `separate=True`.
5. Checks if the result is a list.
6. Checks if the list is sorted.
7. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the list is not sorted.
8. Prints "Issue resolved" if the list is sorted.
9. Catches any other exceptions and prints "Other issues".

5. **Order Check**:
   - If the result matches the expected result directly, print "Issue resolved".
   - If the sorted result matches the sorted expected result, print "Issue reproduced" (indicating an order issue).
   - If neither matches, print "Other issues".

5. Based on the sorted check, it prints out "Issue resolved" if the list is sorted, "Issue reproduced" if the list is not sorted, and "Other issues" if the result is not a list or any other exception occurs. 

This should help to validate whether the function's output is arbitrarily ordered or properly sorted as expected.

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The test imports the `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.
2. **Sample Data:** A sample polynomial dictionary `sample_poly_dict` is created for testing.
3. **Invoke `decompose`:** The `decompose` function is called with `separate=True` on the sample data.
4. **Expected Result:** The expected result is created by sorting the keys of `sample_poly_dict` and then extracting the corresponding values.
5. **Assertion:** The test asserts whether the `decompose` function's result matches the expected sorted result.
6. **Outcome Messages:** The test prints "Issue resolved" if the assertion passes, "Issue reproduced" if it fails, and "Other issues" if any other exception occurs.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue with the arbitrary order and verify whether it has been fixed by ensuring the decompose function returns values in a predictable order.

3. The `decompose` function is called with `poly_dict` and `separate=True`.
4. The outcome of the `decompose` function is checked to see if it is a list and whether it is sorted or not.
5. The appropriate message is printed based on the outcome:
   - "Issue resolved" if the list is sorted.
   - "Issue reproduced" if the list is not sorted.
   - "Other issues" if the outcome is not as expected or if an exception occurs.

        print("Issue reproduced")
    else:
        print("Other issues")

test_decompose_function()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: The `decompose` function is imported from the `intpoly` module.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: 
   - A mock `sample_poly_dict` dictionary is created to simulate the polynomial dictionary input.
   - The `mock_decompose` function simulates the behavior of the `decompose` function, returning a list of values when `separate=True`.
   - The result of the `mock_decompose` function is stored in the `result` variable.
3. **Check the Outcome**:
   - The expected result is the sorted list of polynomial dictionary values.
   - If the result matches the expected sorted result, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the result is a list and contains the same set of values as the dictionary values (indicating arbitrary order), it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "Other issues".

By running this test, you can determine whether the issue with arbitrary ordering in the `decompose` function has been reproduced or resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Import the `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Define a test function `test_decompose_order` that:
   - Creates a `poly_dict` dictionary.
   - Calls the `decompose` function with `separate=True`.
   - Compares the result list with the expected sorted values (assuming the expected behavior is sorted values by keys).
3. **Print statements**: Print "Issue reproduced" if the result is not sorted, "Issue resolved" if the result is sorted, and "Other issues" if the result is not a list.
4. **Simulated decompose function**: Include a basic implementation of the `decompose` function as an example. This part should be replaced with the actual `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.
5. **Run the test**: Finally, call the `test_decompose_order` function to run the test.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The `decompose` function is imported from the `intpoly` module.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: A sample polynomial dictionary is provided to reproduce the issue.
3. **Outcome Verification**: The code checks if the output list is ordered arbitrarily or not.
4. **Printing Outcome**: The script prints "Issue reproduced" if the list is unordered, "Issue resolved" if the output is correctly ordered, and "Other issues" if there are any other issues or exceptions.

This test will help you check if the decompose function's output is ordered or if it still returns an arbitrary order, thus reproducing or resolving the described issue.

Please note:
1. I assumed that the `decompose` function you mentioned is part of a module named `intpoly`. Adjust the import statement accordingly to fit your actual module structure.
2. The example polynomial `"x^2 + 2*x + 1"` is used as a sample input. Replace it with actual test data that matches your use case if needed.
3. This test checks if the resulting list from `decompose` is sorted. If it is not sorted, it prints "Issue reproduced". Otherwise, it prints "Issue resolved". If any other issues occur, it prints "Other issues".

You can run this test to reproduce the issue and use it to verify whether any fixes made resolve the problem.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import the necessary function `decompose` from the `intpoly` module.
2. **Reproducing the Issue**: 
   - Create a sample polynomial dictionary `poly_dict` to simulate input to the `decompose` function with `separate=True`.
   - Obtain the list of values from `poly_dict` using `list(poly_dict.values())`.
3. **Expected Outcome**: Define what the sorted list of values should be using `sorted(poly_dict.values())`.
4. **Issue Verification**:
   - Compare the returned list of values with the expected sorted list.
   - Print "Issue resolved" if they match, indicating the issue has been fixed.
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if they do not match, indicating the issue persists.
5. **Error Handling**: Catch any exceptions and print "Other issues" along with the exception message if any other issue arises.

This test should help in verifying whether the `decompose` function returns an ordered list or not, thereby reproducing or resolving the issue.
2025-05-03 14:30:31,678 - INFO - raw output:
Sure, here is the complete test to reproduce the issue described in the issue text. It includes necessary imports, code to reproduce the issue, and conditions to print appropriate messages based on the outcome.

```python
from intpoly import decompose

def test_decompose_order_issue():
    try:
        poly = "your polynomial here"  # Replace with an actual polynomial input
        result_1 = decompose(poly, separate=True)
        result_2 = decompose(poly, separate=True)
        
        # Check if the order of elements in the list is consistent
        if result_1 != result_2:

            print("Issue resolved")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_decompose_order_issue()
```

Please replace `"your polynomial here"` with an actual polynomial input that is suitable for the `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.

This test will:

1. Call the `decompose` function twice with the same polynomial input.
2. Compare the results to check if the list order is consistent.
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the order is inconsistent, indicating the issue is still present.
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the order is consistent, indicating the issue has been fixed.
5. Print "Other issues" along with the exception message if any other issues are encountered during the test execution.

Make sure you have the `intpoly` module and its `decompose` function available in your environment to run this test.

def test_decompose_order_issue():

        # Example polynomial dictionary that might be used internally in decompose function
        poly_dict = {

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(f"Exception: {e}")

test_decompose_order_issue()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The test includes the import statement for the `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.
2. **Simulated `decompose` function**: Since the actual implementation and input to the `decompose` function are not provided, we simulate the function's behavior based on the issue description.
3. **Test Logic**:
   - A sample `poly_dict` is created to mimic the behavior of `decompose`.
   - The `separate` flag is used to determine whether to return just the values of the dictionary.
   - The output list `result` is checked to see if it is sorted.
4. **Outcome Messages**:
   - If the result list is sorted, it prints "Issue resolved."
   - If the result list is not sorted, it prints "Issue reproduced."
   - If there is any other exception, it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.

This test should be able to indicate whether the issue is reproduced or resolved based on the order of the list returned by the `decompose()` function. You can adjust the sample `poly_dict` and the logic as per the actual implementation details of your `decompose` function.

3. **Dictionary Input**: A sample dictionary `poly_dict_input` is created to simulate the issue.
4. **Function Call**: The `decompose` function is called with `separate=True` and the result is stored.
5. **Sorted Expected Result**: The expected result is generated by sorting the dictionary keys and then obtaining the corresponding values.
6. **Assertions**: 
   - If the result matches the expected sorted list, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the result does not match, it catches the `AssertionError` and prints "Issue reproduced".
   - Any other exceptions will be caught and printed as "Other issues".

Running this test will help verify if the `decompose` function returns values in an ordered manner or if it still returns an unordered list.

# Running the test
test_decompose_function()
```

This test is designed to verify if the `decompose()` function in the `intpoly` module returns a list of polynomial values in a non-deterministic (arbitrary) order. 

To reproduce the issue, the test checks multiple potential orders that the values could be returned in, assuming they might be returned differently each time due to the arbitrary nature of dictionary value extraction.

- If the result is not in any of the expected orders (which are checked comprehensively), the test prints "Issue reproduced".
- If the result is in a stable, predictable order, it prints "Issue resolved".
- Any other exceptions that might indicate different issues with the code are caught and reported as "Other issues".

Please replace the dummy `decompose()` function with the actual implementation from your repository to test effectively.

Sure! Below is a complete test script that corresponds to the issue described in your repository. This script will check if the `decompose()` function in the `intpoly` module is returning a list in arbitrary order, which is causing test failures.

```python
# Assuming the `intpoly` module and `decompose` function are defined in your repository
from intpoly import decompose

def test_decompose_arbitrary_order():
    try:
        # Sample polynomial dictionary for testing
        poly_dict = {
            'a': 1,
            'b': 2,
            'c': 3,
            'd': 4,
            'e': 5
        }
        
        # Call decompose with separate=True (assuming this is the correct usage)
        result = decompose(poly_dict, separate=True)
        
        # Check if the result is ordered arbitrarily
        if result != sorted(result):
            print("Issue reproduced")
        else:
            print("Issue resolved")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues: ", e)

test_decompose_arbitrary_order()
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.
2. Defines a test function `test_decompose_arbitrary_order`.
3. Creates a sample polynomial dictionary named `poly_dict`.
4. Calls the `decompose` function with the `separate=True` argument.
5. Checks if the returned list is sorted. If not, it prints "Issue reproduced".
6. If the list is sorted, it prints "Issue resolved".
7. Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test will help you diagnose if the list returned by `decompose` is in arbitrary order and will assist in verifying when the issue is resolved.

Certainly! Below is the complete test tailored to reproduce the issue described in the issue text. This test assumes that the `decompose` function and the necessary context are correctly imported and available in the test environment.

```python
# Assuming that the required modules and the `decompose` function are defined somewhere in the repository.
from your_module import decompose

def test_decompose_function():
    try:
        # Example polynomial for decomposition. This might need to be changed based on your specific use case.
        poly = "x^2 + 3x + 2"
        
        # Call the decompose function with separate=True to reproduce the issue.
        result = decompose(poly, separate=True)
        
        # Check if the result is a list and check if the order is arbitrary (which can be non-deterministic).
        if isinstance(result, list):
            # If the list is ordered in a changing way, it indicates the issue.
            if result != sorted(result):
                print("Issue reproduced")
            else:

        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_decompose_function()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The `decompose` function is imported from the relevant module.
2. **Test Function**:
   - **Example Polynomial**: A basic polynomial example is used for the decomposition. Adjust this based on your specific context.
   - **Function Call**: The `decompose` function is called with `separate=True` to see if it returns a list with arbitrary order.
   - **Type Check**: Verifies if the output is a list.
   - **Order Check**: Compares the result with its sorted version. If they don't match, it implies the order is arbitrary, reproducing the issue.
3. **Print Statements**:
   - **Issue Reproduced**: Printed if the output list is in arbitrary order.
   - **Issue Resolved**: Printed if the output list is already sorted.
   - **Other Issues**: Printed if the output is not a list or if any unexpected exception occurs.

Make sure to replace `"your_module"` with the actual module name where the `decompose` function is defined. Also, adjust the polynomial example as per your actual use case for better relevancy.

test_decompose_function()
```

In this test, `decompose` is called with `separate=True` and the result is compared with the expected sorted order of the values in the dictionary. If the result is not in the expected order, the issue is reproduced, otherwise, the issue is resolved. If any other exception occurs during the execution, it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.
2025-05-03 14:30:31,678 - INFO - raw output:
To generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue described in the issue text, we need to follow the steps mentioned. The primary issue is that the `decompose()` function in the `intpoly` module returns a list of arbitrary order when `separate=True`. We need to create a test that checks the order of the list returned by this function.

Here's the generated test:

```python
from intpoly import decompose

def test_decompose_function() -> None:
    try:
        # Example polynomial dictionary to use for the test
        poly_dict = {
            "x^2 + y^2": 1,
            "y^2 + z^2": 1,
            "x^2 + z^2": 1
        }
        
        # Call the decompose function with separate=True
        result = decompose(poly_dict, separate=True)
        
        # Check if the result is of type list
        assert isinstance(result, list), "Returned value is not a list"
        
        # Check if the list is sorted
        sorted_result = sorted(result)
        if result != sorted_result:
            print("Issue reproduced")
        else:
            print("Issue resolved")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(f"Exception occurred: {e}")

test_decompose_function()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**:
   - Import the `decompose` function from the `intpoly` module.

2. **Reproducing the Issue**:
   - Define a sample `poly_dict` for the test.
   - Call the `decompose` function with `separate=True`.
   - Assert that the result is a list.
   - Check if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.
   - If the list is not sorted, print "Issue reproduced".
   - If the list is sorted, print "Issue resolved".

3. **Handling Other Issues**:
   - If there are any exceptions or other issues, catch them and print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

Make sure to replace the `poly_dict` and the call to the `decompose` function with actual values and functions relevant to your `intpoly` module for an accurate test.
