legend draggable as keyword
<!--To help us understand and resolve your issue, please fill out the form to the best of your ability.-->

### Feature request

**There is not keyword to make legend draggable at creation**

<!--A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug-->

Is there a code reason why one can not add a "draggable=True" keyword to the __init__ function for Legend?  This would be more handy than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason why it would not work?

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A figure and axis are created using `plt.subplots()`.
   - A simple line plot is created and labeled.
   - The script attempts to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the legend is created successfully with the `draggable=True` keyword, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If a `TypeError` is raised and the error message contains "draggable", it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - For any other exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

Sure, here is a complete test that can be used to reproduce and verify the issue described in the issue text regarding the legend's draggable keyword:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.plot([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 4], label='Data')

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(f"Exception: {e}")

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The `matplotlib.pyplot` module is imported to create the plot and legend.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: 
    - A simple plot is created using `matplotlib`.
    - An attempt is made to add a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword directly in the `ax.legend()` function call.
    - If a `TypeError` is raised (indicating that the `draggable` keyword is not accepted), it prints "Issue reproduced".
3. **Verify Resolution**:
    - If no error is raised, the code checks if the legend is actually draggable using `legend.get_draggable()`.
    - If the legend is draggable, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If the legend is not draggable or if other issues occur, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be run before and after making modifications to the source code to verify if the issue is resolved.

Certainly! Below is the complete test to reproduce and verify the issue described in the issue text. This test script aims to check whether the "draggable=True" keyword can be added to the `__init__` function of the `Legend` class and whether this makes the legend draggable upon creation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], label='line')
        
        # Attempt to create legend with draggable set to True during initialization
        try:
            legend = ax.legend(draggable=True)
        except TypeError as e:
            print("Issue reproduced")
            return
        
        # Check if the legend is actually draggable
        if legend.get_draggable():
            print("Issue resolved")
        else:
            print("Other issues")
            
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    return

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

This test script performs the following steps:
1. Creates a figure and axis using `matplotlib`.
2. Plots a simple line graph.
3. Attempts to create the legend with the `draggable=True` keyword during initialization.
4. If a `TypeError` is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced" indicating that the keyword is not supported during initialization.
5. If no error is raised, it checks if the legend is draggable and prints "Issue resolved" if it is, otherwise prints "Other issues".

By running this test, you can check whether the keyword issue described in the issue text is reproduced or resolved.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**:
    - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
  
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - Create a simple plot using Matplotlib.
    - Try to add a legend with the new `draggable=True` keyword directly in the `ax.legend()` call.

3. **Print Statements**:
    - If the keyword is not recognized (i.e., raises a `TypeError` mentioning `draggable`), print "Issue reproduced".
    - If the legend is successfully created with the `draggable` property set, print "Issue resolved".
    - Handle other exceptions and print "Other issues" if they arise.

This script should help you determine whether the addition of the `draggable=True` keyword to the `Legend` class's `__init__` function has been implemented and verify if it works as expected.

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

This test performs the following steps:

1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Creates a simple plot with a legend.
3. Attempts to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
4. Checks if the `TypeError` is raised when trying to pass the `draggable=True` keyword (implying that the keyword does not exist).
5. If the legend is created without issues, it verifies if the legend is draggable.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the `TypeError` is raised or if the legend is not draggable, implying the initial problem is still present.
7. Prints "Issue resolved" if the legend is successfully made draggable using the keyword.
8. Prints "Other issues" if any unexpected exceptions occur.

Running this test will help determine whether the issue has been resolved or if it still persists.

Certainly! Below is a complete test script that reflects the issue described in the provided issue text. This script aims to reproduce the issue regarding the lack of a "draggable" keyword for the `Legend` class in the given context, presumably within a plotting library like Matplotlib.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        lines = ax.plot([1, 2, 3], label="Test Line")
        
        # Attempt to create a legend with a 'draggable' keyword
        try:
            legend = ax.legend(draggable=True)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as it's a commonly used library for plotting that includes a `Legend` class.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - A simple plot is created.
    - An attempt is made to create a legend while passing a `draggable` keyword during its initialization.
3. **Print Statements**:
    - If the `draggable` keyword works as expected and makes the legend draggable, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If a `TypeError` is raised indicating the `draggable` keyword is unexpected, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".

By running this script, you can verify whether the issue described in the issue text (the absence of a `draggable` keyword in the `Legend` class) is present and whether it has been subsequently resolved.

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

### Explanation

1. **Necessary imports**: The `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported to create plots and legends.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: A simple plot is created, and the legend is attempted to be created with `draggable=True` keyword.
3. **Print statements to indicate the outcome**:
   - "Issue resolved" if the keyword is accepted and no error is thrown.
   - "Issue reproduced" if a `TypeError` with the message "got an unexpected keyword argument 'draggable'" is caught.
   - "Other issues" if any other exception is raised.

This code will help in verifying whether the issue is reproduced or resolved and will provide appropriate feedback if there are other issues.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules from `matplotlib`.
2. Creates a simple plot with a legend.
3. Attempts to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
4. Checks if the legend is draggable right after creation.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the legend is created with the `draggable=True` keyword without any issues and confirms its draggable state.
6. Prints "Issue reproduced" if a `TypeError` is raised, indicating that the `draggable` keyword is not accepted during initialization.
7. Prints "Other issues" if any other unexpected exceptions are encountered.

This test can be used to verify if the `draggable` keyword can be added during the creation of the legend and to check the appropriate behavior.

Here is the breakdown of the test:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports necessary modules from `matplotlib` to create a plot and a legend.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The script attempts to create a `Legend` object with a `draggable` keyword argument.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If the `draggable` keyword is accepted without raising an error, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the `draggable` keyword causes a `TypeError`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exceptions are raised, it prints "Other issues".

This script should be able to reproduce the issue if the `draggable` keyword is not accepted, and it will also confirm if the issue has been resolved in case the keyword is accepted without any errors.

        line, = ax.plot([1, 2, 3], label="Test Line")
        
        # Try to create a legend with a draggable keyword
        try:

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

In this script:
1. We import the necessary library `matplotlib.pyplot`.
2. A simple plot is created with a line and a corresponding legend.
3. We attempt to create a legend using the `draggable=True` keyword in the `ax.legend` method.
4. If a `TypeError` is raised, it indicates that the `draggable` keyword is not accepted, which means the issue is reproduced.
5. If no exception is raised, we check if the legend is indeed draggable. If it is, the issue is resolved. Otherwise, we print "Other issues".

This test should help in verifying if the `draggable` keyword can be accepted at the creation of the legend. If the issue is resolved in the codebase, the test will print "Issue resolved". If the issue persists, it will print "Issue reproduced". If any other issue is encountered, it will print "Other issues".

To help you generate a complete test to reproduce the issue described in the provided issue text, I'll assume that you are using a plotting library like Matplotlib, which is commonly used for creating legends in plots. The issue text suggests that there's a desire to add a `draggable=True` keyword to the `Legend` creation process. 

Here is a complete test that you can use:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test_draggable_legend_at_creation():
    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        line1, = ax.plot([1, 2, 3], label='Line 1')
        
        # Try to create a legend with draggable=True
        try:
            legend = ax.legend(draggable=True)
        except TypeError as e:
            print("Issue reproduced")
            return

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(e)

test_draggable_legend_at_creation()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The code starts by importing `matplotlib.pyplot` which is necessary for creating the plot and the legend.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - A simple plot is created using `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`.
    - A line is plotted and labeled.
    - The legend is attempted to be created with `draggable=True`. If this causes an error (specifically a `TypeError`), it indicates that the keyword is not recognized, reproducing the issue.
3. **Print outcomes**: Based on whether the legend creation with `draggable=True` succeeds or not, the appropriate message is printed:
    - If an error is encountered, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If the legend is successfully created and it's indeed draggable, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If other issues arise, it prints "Other issues".

This test will help you verify if the `draggable=True` keyword can be added during the legend creation, or if it still needs to be set after the legend is created.

### Explanation

1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - A simple plot is created.
    - The script tries to create a legend with a `draggable=True` keyword argument in the `__init__` method.

3. **Outcome Handling**:
    - If a `TypeError` is raised and it contains the string "draggable", the script prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If no exception is raised and the legend is draggable, the script prints "Issue resolved".
    - Any other exceptions or issues are captured and "Other issues" is printed.

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The necessary imports from `matplotlib`.
2. **Test Function:** The function `test_legend_draggable_keyword` handles the creation of a figure and axis, and attempts to create a `Legend` object with a `draggable=True` keyword.
3. **Exception Handling:** If a `TypeError` is raised and it contains the word "draggable", it prints "Issue reproduced". This indicates that the `draggable` keyword is not accepted.
4. **Draggable Check:** If no exception is raised, it checks if the legend is draggable using `legend.get_draggable()`. If the legend is draggable, it prints "Issue resolved".
5. **General Exception Handling:** Any other exceptions are caught and "Other issues" is printed.

This test can be used to verify whether the `draggable` keyword for the `Legend` class works as intended or reproduces the issue described.

2. **Creates a plot with a line and a legend**: This sets up the context for the test.
3. **Attempts to create a legend with the `draggable` keyword**:
   - If the `draggable` keyword is not supported, a `TypeError` should be raised, indicating the issue is reproduced.
   - If the `draggable` keyword is successfully recognized, it indicates the issue has been resolved.
   - Any other exception falls under "Other issues."

This test can be used both to reproduce the issue and to verify if it has been fixed in future updates.

        return

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: The necessary `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported.
2. **Plot Creation**: A simple plot is created with a single line and a legend.
3. **Legend Creation**: The test attempts to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
4. **Exception Handling**: 
   - If a `TypeError` is raised, it indicates that the `draggable` keyword is not accepted during legend creation, hence "Issue reproduced" is printed.
   - If any other exception is raised, "Other issues" is printed.
5. **Draggable Check**: 
   - If no exception is raised, the code checks if the legend is actually draggable. If it is, "Issue resolved" is printed. Otherwise, "Issue reproduced" is printed.

This test should help in both reproducing the current issue and verifying if it has been resolved.

Sure, here is a complete test script that you can use to reproduce the issue described in the issue text regarding making the legend draggable at creation time using a keyword. 

Before running the test, ensure you have the necessary packages installed (e.g., `matplotlib`).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], label='Line 1')
        ax.plot([0, 1], [1, 0], label='Line 2')

        # Attempt to create a Legend with a draggable keyword
        try:
            legend = ax.legend(draggable=True)
            print("Issue resolved")
        except TypeError as e:
            if 'draggable' in str(e):
                print("Issue reproduced")
            else:
                print("Other issues")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Other issues: {e}")
        else:
            print("Legend created successfully with draggable keyword.")
        
        plt.close(fig)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** The script imports the necessary `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - A figure and axis are created using `plt.subplots()`.
   - Two lines are plotted on the axis.
   - An attempt is made to create a legend with `draggable=True` keyword directly in the `ax.legend()` function.
3. **Printing the Result:**
   - If a `TypeError` occurs and the message contains 'draggable', it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other type of error occurs or if the issue stems from another cause, it prints "Other issues".
   - If the legend is created successfully with the `draggable` keyword, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test covers the scenario described in the issue text and allows you to verify both the reproduction of the issue and the resolution if the issue is fixed.

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    # Setup the data for the plot
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], label="Line 1")

    # Try to create a legend with a draggable keyword
    try:
        legend = Legend(ax, handles=ax.get_lines(), labels=[h.get_label() for h in ax.get_lines()], draggable=True)
        ax.add_artist(legend)

```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
   - `from matplotlib.legend import Legend`

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - We create a simple plot with a line.
   - We attempt to create a legend with a `draggable=True` keyword in the `Legend` constructor.

3. **Print Statements for Different Outcomes**:
   - If the legend is draggable after creation, print "Issue resolved".
   - If a `TypeError` is raised, indicating that the `draggable` keyword is not accepted in the `Legend` constructor, print "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception occurs, print "Other issues" with the exception message.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting and `matplotlib.legend` for the legend.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The test tries to create a legend with the hypothetical keyword `draggable=True`. 
3. **Outcome Checks**:
    - If a `TypeError` occurs due to an unexpected keyword argument `draggable`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If any other error occurs, it prints "Other issues".
    - If no error occurs and the legend is correctly marked as draggable, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If the legend is not draggable even though no error occurred, it prints "Other issues".

This test follows the required steps:

1. **Necessary imports**: It imports `matplotlib.pyplot`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: It attempts to create a `Legend` object with the `draggable=True` keyword.
3. **Print "Issue reproduced"**: If the specific TypeError related to the missing `draggable` keyword is caught.
4. **Print "Issue resolved"**: If the `Legend` object is created without issues.
5. **Print "Other issues"**: If any other unexpected issues arise.

This test will help verify if the `draggable` keyword can be added to the `__init__` function for `Legend` during its creation and will handle different outcomes accordingly.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import necessary modules from matplotlib.
2. **Setup**: Create a simple plot with a line that will be labeled.
3. **Test**: Attempt to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword within the `Legend` initialization.
4. **Check**: Verify if the legend is draggable by calling `legend.get_draggable()`.
5. **Output**:
   - Print "Issue resolved" if the legend is draggable as expected.
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if the `draggable` keyword is not accepted or the legend is not draggable.
   - Print "Other issues" if any other unexpected issues occur.

This test will help to verify if the `draggable` keyword can be accepted during the creation of a `Legend` object and if it functions as intended.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as plt.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The function `test_legend_draggable_keyword` tries to create a legend using the `draggable` keyword in the `__init__` method.
3. **Outcome Checking**: 
   - If a `TypeError` with the message containing "unexpected keyword argument 'draggable'" is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the legend is created without any exceptions, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other exceptions that might indicate other issues print "Other issues". 
4. **Execution**: Finally, the test function is called to execute the test.

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been fixed. Once the feature `draggable` keyword in the `__init__` method of the `Legend` class is implemented, running this test should print "Issue resolved".

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting and `matplotlib.legend.Legend` for creating legends.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: A custom `DraggableLegend` class is created, which extends the `Legend` class and adds a `draggable` keyword to the `__init__` function. If `draggable=True` is passed, it sets the legend to be draggable.
3. **Outcome Printing**:
   - If the legend is draggable (`assert legend.get_draggable() is True`), it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If an `AttributeError` occurs, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".

This test simulates what happens when a `draggable=True` keyword is included during legend creation and checks if it is properly set. If not, it reproduces the issue.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** The test starts with importing `matplotlib.pyplot` as it is needed for creating the plot and legend.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** The code creates a simple plot and attempts to add a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
3. **Outcome Evaluation:**
   - If a `TypeError` is raised during legend creation with the `draggable=True` keyword, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the legend is created without error and `draggable` property is checked, it prints "Issue resolved" if the legend is draggable.
   - In case of any other issues during the process, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Assertions and Outcome:** The test is designed to indicate whether the issue has been reproduced or resolved based on whether the `draggable=True` keyword can be used directly in the `legend` creation.

Sure, I will create a test to reproduce the issue mentioned in the issue text. The objective is to check if we can add a "draggable=True" keyword to the `__init__` function for a `Legend` object at creation. 

Here is the complete test:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.legend import Legend

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line, = ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], label='Test Line')
    
    try:
        # Attempt to create a legend with a "draggable=True" keyword
        legend = Legend(ax, handles=[line], labels=['Test Line'], draggable=True)
        ax.add_artist(legend)
        
        # Check if the legend is draggable
        if legend.draggable():
            print("Issue resolved")
        else:
            print("Issue reproduced")
    except TypeError as e:
        if "got an unexpected keyword argument 'draggable'" in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced")
        else:
            print("Other issues")

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

In this test:
1. I create a simple plot with one line.
2. I attempt to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
3. If the `draggable` keyword argument is not accepted by the `Legend` `__init__` method, a `TypeError` will be raised, and the test will print "Issue reproduced".
4. If no error is raised and the legend is draggable, it will print "Issue resolved".
5. If there are other issues, it will print "Other issues".

This test should help you both reproduce the issue if the `draggable` keyword is not accepted, and verify if the issue has been fixed once the code is updated to support the `draggable` keyword in the `Legend` `__init__` method.
2025-05-03 14:16:17,666 - INFO - raw output:
Certainly! Below is the complete test to reproduce the issue described in the issue text. This test assumes the existence of a `Legend` class with an `__init__` method that does not currently support a `draggable` keyword argument.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test_legend_draggable():
    try:
        # Create a simple plot
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.plot([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 4], label="Sample Line")
        
        # Attempt to create a legend with draggable keyword
        try:
            legend = ax.legend(draggable=True)
            if legend.get_draggable():
                print("Issue resolved")
            else:
                print("Issue reproduced")
        except TypeError as e:
            print("Issue reproduced")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
        print(e)

    plt.close(fig)

test_legend_draggable()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The necessary imports are included (`matplotlib.pyplot`).
2. **Reproduction Code:** The code creates a simple plot and attempts to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
3. **Outcome Checking:**
   - If the legend is successfully created and draggable, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If a `TypeError` is raised (since the `draggable` keyword is not supported), it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - Any other exceptions are captured and printed as "Other issues".

This test will help verify if the `draggable=True` keyword can be added to the `__init__` method for the `Legend` or if there are any other underlying issues.
2025-05-03 14:16:17,666 - INFO - raw output:
To address the issue regarding the `draggable` keyword for the `Legend` class, we will generate a test script that follows the structure you provided. This script will:

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Create a test case to see if we can add a `draggable=True` keyword during the initialization of a `Legend` object.
3. Verify if the behavior is as expected, and print the appropriate message based on the outcome.

Here's the complete test:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line, = ax.plot([1, 2, 3], label='test')

    try:
        # Attempt to create a legend with a draggable keyword
        legend = ax.legend(draggable=True)
        # Check if the legend is indeed draggable
        if legend.get_draggable():
            print("Issue resolved")
        else:
            print("Issue reproduced")
    except TypeError as e:
        # If TypeError is raised, it means draggable is not a valid keyword
        if 'draggable' in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced")
        else:
            print("Other issues")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Plot Setup**: We create a simple plot with a line and a legend.
3. **Test Case**:
   - We attempt to create a legend with the `draggable=True` keyword.
   - We check if the legend is draggable.
   - If the legend is draggable, we print "Issue resolved".
   - If a `TypeError` is raised with 'draggable' in the error message, the issue is reproduced, and we print "Issue reproduced".
   - For any other exceptions, we print "Other issues".

### Usage:
- Run this test as is to check if the issue is indeed present.
- After making changes to the repository to add the `draggable` keyword to the legend's `__init__`, re-run the test to verify if the issue has been resolved.

This script will help you identify if the `draggable` keyword can be used directly during the initialization of the `Legend` object and if the issue is resolved after making the necessary changes.

This script does the following:

1. Imports the necessary `matplotlib.pyplot` module.
2. Creates a simple plot.
3. Attempts to add a legend to the plot using the `draggable=True` keyword.
4. Catches and checks for a `TypeError` specifically related to the `draggable` keyword.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the `TypeError` indicates that the keyword is not accepted.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if the legend is created without any issues.
7. Prints "Other issues" for any other exceptions that may arise.

Run this script in your environment to reproduce the issue and verify if it has been resolved.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The code imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` to create a plot and legend.
2. **Reproducing the issue**: The test creates a simple plot and then tries to create a legend using the `draggable=True` keyword. If the `TypeError` mentioning `draggable` is raised, it means the issue is reproduced.
3. **Verifying the fix**: If no exception is raised, it checks if the legend is draggable and prints "Issue resolved" if it is.
4. **Handling other issues**: If the legend is not draggable or any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".

This test ensures that the issue can be reproduced, verified, and any other issues can be identified.

Sure, let's generate a complete test script that reflects the issue described in your issue text. The script will attempt to create a draggable legend during its initialization and check whether the issue is reproduced or resolved.

Here is the complete test script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.legend import Legend

def test_legend_draggable_keyword():
    # Step 1: Setup the plot
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    lines = ax.plot([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0], label="Line 1")
    
    # Step 2: Attempt to create a draggable legend using the draggable keyword in __init__
    try:
        legend = Legend(ax, lines, labels=["Line 1"], draggable=True)
        ax.add_artist(legend)
        
        if legend.get_draggable():
            print("Issue resolved")

    except Exception as e:
        print("Other issues")
    
    plt.close(fig)

test_legend_draggable_keyword()
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The necessary modules `matplotlib.pyplot` and `matplotlib.legend.Legend` are imported.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**:
   - A simple plot is created.
   - The test attempts to create a `Legend` instance with a `draggable=True` keyword during initialization.
   - If a `TypeError` is raised (which would happen if the `draggable` keyword is not recognized), it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the legend is created successfully and is draggable, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other exception will print "Other issues".

This script should help diagnose whether the `draggable=True` keyword can be used during the creation of a `Legend` object in the current state of the repository.
