--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
socket.error exception not caught/wrapped in a requests exception (ConnectionError perhaps?)
I just noticed a case where I had a socket reset on me, and was raised to me as a raw socket error as opposed to something like a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:

Not sure if this is by accident or design... in general, I guess I'd expect a requests exception when using requests, but I can start looking for socket errors and the like as well.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary imports**: The test includes imports for `requests`, `socket`, and `ConnectionError`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test makes a request to a URL that is expected to reset the connection, simulating the socket error.
3. **Print "Issue reproduced"**: The test checks if a `socket.error` is raised and prints "Issue reproduced".
4. **Print "Issue resolved"**: If a `ConnectionError` is raised (indicating the issue has been resolved and the socket error is properly caught/wrapped), it prints "Issue resolved".
5. **Print "Other issues"**: This handles any other unforeseen issues.

This test should help in verifying whether the socket errors are being properly caught and wrapped in a `requests` exception. To fully implement this, you might need a real environment where the connection reset by peer can be simulated, or mock the network interactions using a library like `responses` or similar.

Sure, I'll generate a complete test script to reproduce the described issue with the `requests` library. The test will simulate a socket error and verify whether it is caught as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` or not.

Here is the full test script:

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import ConnectionError
from unittest.mock import patch, Mock

def test_socket_error_handling():
    # Mocking the response to raise a socket error
    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.raw.stream.side_effect = socket.error("[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer")
    
    # Patch the requests.get method to return the mocked response
    with patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response):
        try:
            response = requests.get('http://example.com')
            # Attempt to read the content, which will trigger the socket error
            content = response.content
            print("Other issues")
        except ConnectionError:
            print("Issue resolved")
        except socket.error:
            print("Issue reproduced")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Other issues: {e}")

test_socket_error_handling()
```

This script:
1. Imports the necessary modules: `requests`, `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`, `patch` and `Mock` from `unittest.mock`, and `socket`.
2. Defines a function `test_socket_error_handling` which simulates a socket error.
3. Mocks the response from `requests.get` to raise a socket error.
4. Patches the `requests.get` method to return the mocked response.
5. Attempts to read the content of the response, which will raise the mocked socket error.
6. Checks if the socket error is caught as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` or not, and prints the appropriate message.

This test will help diagnose whether the socket error is appropriately wrapped in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. If the issue is not resolved, it prints "Issue reproduced". If it is caught as a `ConnectionError`, it prints "Issue resolved". If any other exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".

In this test:
1. We import the necessary modules: `requests`, `socket`, and `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`.
2. We attempt to make a GET request to a server that will forcefully close the connection to simulate a "Connection reset by peer" scenario.
3. We try to access the content of the response, which should trigger the issue if it hasn't been resolved.
4. If a `ConnectionError` is caught, it indicates that the issue has been resolved because the raw `socket.error` is wrapped in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
5. If a `socket.error` with errno 104 is caught, it indicates that the issue is reproduced.
6. If other exceptions are caught, it indicates other issues.

This test allows you to verify both the reproduction of the issue and its resolution.

test_socket_error_handling()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** The script imports `requests`, `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`, `socket`, and `mock` from `unittest`.
2. **Mocking socket error:** The `mock_recv` function simulates a socket error, which is used to patch `socket.socket.recv` method.
3. **Reproducing the issue:** The `test_socket_error_handling` function makes a mock request to a URL and tries to access the response content, which will trigger the mocked socket error.
4. **Handling exceptions:** The function catches `ConnectionError` to indicate the issue is resolved, `socket.error` to reproduce the issue, and any other exceptions to print "Other issues".

In this test:
1. `unittest.mock.patch` is used to mock the `socket.socket.recv` method to simulate a `socket.error` with errno 104 ("Connection reset by peer").
2. The test attempts to make an HTTP GET request using `requests.get`.
3. If a `socket.error` with errno 104 is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` is caught instead, it prints "Issue resolved".
5. Any other exceptions or issues are caught and print "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. Imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. Defines an HTTP server handler that writes a partial response and then closes the connection abruptly to simulate a socket reset.
3. Starts the HTTP server in a separate thread so that it can run concurrently with the test.
4. Implements the test function `test_socket_error_not_caught` which sends a request to the server and tries to read the response.
5. If the socket error occurs and it's the specific error for connection reset (Errno 104), it prints "Issue reproduced".
6. If a `ConnectionError` is raised instead, it prints "Issue resolved".
7. Catches any other exceptions and prints "Other issues".

This setup enables the reproduction of the issue described in the initial text and can be used to verify if the issue has been addressed properly.

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: I included the necessary imports such as `requests`, `socket`, and `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`.
2. **Mock Server**: Using `Flask` and `threading` to create a mock server that will simulate a connection reset by forcing a server error.
3. **Request**: Sending a request to the mock server to trigger the error.
4. **Exception Handling**: 
   - Catching the `socket.error` to check if the specific error code `104` (Connection reset by peer) is raised to reproduce the issue.
   - Catching `ConnectionError` from `requests` to indicate that the issue has been resolved if wrapped correctly.
   - Catching other exceptions to handle different potential issues.

This test will help to reproduce the issue as described and also verify if the issue has been resolved in future fixes.

This test includes:
1. Necessary imports: `requests`, `socket`, and `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`.
2. Code to reproduce the issue by setting up a mock server that intentionally resets the socket connection.
3. Logic to catch either the raw `socket.error` or `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` and print the appropriate message:
   - "Issue reproduced" if a `socket.error` with `errno` 104 is encountered.
   - "Issue resolved" if a `ConnectionError` is encountered instead.
   - "Other issues" for any other exceptions or outcomes.

The test uses a mock HTTP server running locally to simulate the connection reset scenario as described in the issue.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The required modules `requests`, `socket`, and `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` have been imported.
2. **Mock Classes**: Created `MockSocket` and `MockResponse` classes to simulate the socket error.
3. **Mock `requests.get`**: Patched the `requests.get` function to return a mock response with a simulated raw stream.
4. **Test Logic**: 
   - Attempted to trigger the issue by accessing the `text` attribute of the response.
   - Printed "Issue reproduced" if a `socket.error` with `errno.ECONNRESET` is caught.
   - Printed "Issue resolved" if a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` is caught.
   - Printed "Other issues" for any other exceptions.

This test should reproduce the issue described in the provided issue text and help verify if the issue is resolved.

This test tries to simulate the scenario described in the issue:
1. It sets up a mock HTTP server that prematurely closes the connection to simulate a socket error.
2. It then makes a request to this mock server using `requests.get`.
3. If a `ConnectionError` is caught, it prints "Issue reproduced".
4. If no exception occurs, it prints "Issue resolved".
5. If other socket-related errors occur, it prints "Other issues" along with the error message.

This setup will help to verify if the issue with the socket error not being caught as a `ConnectionError` is still present or resolved.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Necessary modules (`requests`, `ConnectionError`) are imported.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: The `requests.get` call is made to `http://httpbin.org/delay/10` which delays the response, likely causing a timeout and simulating a connection reset scenario.
3. **Handling Exceptions**:
   - `ConnectionError` is caught to mark the issue as resolved.
   - `socket.error` is caught to mark the issue as reproduced.
   - Other exceptions are caught to indicate other issues.
4. **Print Statements**: Each branch prints appropriate messages based on the caught exceptions.

This test can be used to check if the raw `socket.error` is being raised or if it is caught and wrapped into `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The script imports `requests` for making HTTP requests, `socket` for handling socket-specific errors, and `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions` to check if the issue is resolved.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: A request is made to an IP address (`http://10.255.255.1`) that is expected to produce a socket error, simulating the "Connection reset by peer" scenario. The script then attempts to read the response content, which should trigger the error handling.
3. **Print Statements**:
   - **Issue reproduced**: Printed if the specific socket error `[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer` is caught.
   - **Issue resolved**: Printed if the error is caught and wrapped as a `ConnectionError` by `requests`.
   - **Other issues**: Printed if any other error or unexpected behavior occurs.

### Usage:
This script tests whether the issue described is reproducible and checks if it has been fixed in the requests library. The URL used (`http://10.255.255.1`) is a non-routable IP address expected to time out or fail, which is helpful for simulating the error condition. Adjust the URL if needed to ensure it produces the desired error on your network.

            if e.errno == socket.errno.ECONNRESET:

                print("Issue reproduced")
            else:

            # If we catch any other exception, it's another issue
            print("Other issues")

test_socket_error_handling()
```

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** The necessary imports include `requests`, `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`, and `socket`. Additionally, `mock` from `unittest` is used to simulate the socket error.
2. **Mocking `recv`:** The `mock_socket_recv` function simulates the socket error (`socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`).
3. **Test Function:** The `test_socket_error_handling` function sends a HTTP GET request to `http://example.com` using the `requests` library.
4. **Exception Handling:**
   - **ConnectionError:** If caught, it signifies the issue is resolved.
   - **socket.error:** Specifically for `ECONNRESET`, it signifies the issue is reproduced.
   - **Other Exceptions:** Indicate other issues.

This test directly addresses the issue of catching the `socket.error` and verifying if it is appropriately wrapped in a `requests` exception.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import the necessary modules including `requests`, `socket`, and `ConnectionError`.
2. **Server Setup**: We set up a local HTTP server that will accept a connection and then immediately reset it to simulate the issue.
3. **Request Execution**: A request is made to the server, and an error is expected on reading the response content.
4. **Error Handling**: The error is caught, and based on whether it's a `socket.error`, `ConnectionError`, or another exception, the appropriate message is printed. This will help determine if the raw `socket.error` is still being raised or if it has been wrapped in a `requests` exception.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - `requests`: To perform HTTP requests.
   - `socket`: To simulate socket errors.
   - `HTTPAdapter` and `Retry` from `requests`: To create a mock HTTP adapter that raises a socket error.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - The `MockHTTPAdapter` class extends `HTTPAdapter` and overrides the `send` method to raise a `socket.error` with the message "Connection reset by peer".
   - A `requests.Session` is created and the `MockHTTPAdapter` is mounted to handle HTTP requests, simulating the behavior described in the issue.

3. **Outcome Indication**:
   - If the `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` is caught, it implies that the issue has been resolved.
   - If a `socket.error` is caught with the specific message "Connection reset by peer", it implies that the issue is reproduced.
   - If any other exception is caught, it indicates there are other issues.

The test should be able to reproduce the issue and verify if it has been resolved by catching the appropriate exceptions.

```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Imports `requests`, `socket`, and `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - Creates a `MockSocket` class that simulates a socket error when `recv` is called.
   - Creates a `MockResponse` class that simulates the response object of a `requests` call, raising a socket error when `read` is called.
   - Mocks `requests.get` to return an instance of `MockResponse`.
3. **Outcome handling**:
   - Catches the `ConnectionError` to print "Issue resolved" if the issue is fixed.
   - Catches the `socket.error` to print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is still present.
   - Catches any other exceptions to print "Other issues".

This setup helps to both reproduce the issue and confirm if it has been resolved.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports `requests`, `socket`, and `ConnectionError` from `requests.exceptions`.
2. **Mock server setup**: A mock server using `socketserver.TCPServer` is created. This server will send a partial response and then reset the connection to simulate the described issue.
3. **Server thread handling**: The server runs in a separate thread to handle incoming requests concurrently with the main script.
4. **Request execution**: The script performs a request to the mock server.
5. **Error handling**: The script attempts to access the response content. If a `socket.error` with errno 104 is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced". If a `ConnectionError` is raised, it prints "Issue resolved". For any other exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

This test will help identify if the issue with the uncaught `socket.error` can be reproduced and if changes to the code resolve it by catching the error and raising a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` instead.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** We import `requests`, `ConnectionError`, `RequestException`, and `socket`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** We create a simple HTTP server that intentionally closes the connection after sending a partial response to simulate the "Connection reset by peer" scenario described in the issue.
3. **Outcome Handling:** We handle the possible exceptions:
   - If a `ConnectionError` is raised, it indicates the issue might have been resolved.
   - If a raw `socket.error` with errno 104 is raised, the issue is reproduced.
   - Other exceptions are handled to indicate other issues.
4. **Server in Separate Thread:** We run the server in a separate thread to allow the test to perform the request asynchronously. 

This test should reproduce the issue by simulating a connection reset and checking if the appropriate exception is raised and caught as expected.

This test script sets up a mock server that listens for requests. It then attempts to simulate a "Connection reset by peer" error by manually raising a `socket.error` with the appropriate error number. The script is designed to check whether this error is properly caught and translated into a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. The output will indicate whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues with the code.

Note that this script uses Flask to create a simple HTTP server and threading to run the server concurrently with the test. This setup allows you to simulate the conditions described in the issue text.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports `requests`, `socket`, and `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
2. **Mock Server Setup**: A mock HTTP server is created using Python's `http.server` to simulate a connection reset by peer scenario.
3. **Run Mock Server**: The server is run in a separate thread to handle incoming requests.
4. **Test Request**: A request is made to the mock server, which will trigger a connection reset.
5. **Exception Handling**: The test checks for different exceptions:
   - If `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` is raised, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If `socket.error` with errno 104 (connection reset by peer) is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - For any other exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

# Run the test
test_socket_error_not_wrapped()
```

This test script sets up a small server that accepts a connection and immediately resets it, simulating the client's experience of a connection reset by peer. When the client (the `requests` library) tries to get a response from this server, it will likely encounter a `socket.error`. The test checks if this error is properly wrapped in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

Please note that to run this script, you will need the `requests` library installed, which you can install using `pip install requests`. Additionally, make sure the necessary imports for `struct` and `time` are in place.

test_socket_error_handling()
```

In this test:
1. We use Flask to create a simple server that immediately closes the socket connection to simulate a `socket.error` with `errno 104`.
2. We attempt to make a request to this server using the `requests` library.
3. We catch and classify the specific `socket.error` to determine if the issue is reproduced.
4. We handle the case where a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` is thrown to check if the issue is resolved.
5. We handle any other exceptions to check for other issues.

This test will attempt to mock a scenario where a `socket.error` is raised during the reading of a response. The test checks if the `socket.error` is caught and handled as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. If the issue is reproduced as described, it will print "Issue reproduced". If the issue is resolved and the appropriate exception is raised, it will print "Issue resolved". Any other exceptions will result in "Other issues" being printed.

test_socket_error_not_caught()
```

This test script will attempt to reproduce the socket error issue described in the provided issue text. Here's what it does:

1. It patches the `recv` method of the `socket.socket` class to raise a `socket.error` with an error number of 104, simulating a "Connection reset by peer" scenario.
2. It tries to make a request using the `requests` library to trigger the error.
3. If the error is caught and appropriately wrapped in a `ConnectionError`, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. If the raw `socket.error` is raised instead, it prints "Issue reproduced".
5. If any other exceptions are raised, it prints "Other issues".
