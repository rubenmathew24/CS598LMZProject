--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
[ENH]: Axes.set_xticks/Axis.set_ticks only validates kwargs if ticklabels are set, but they should
### Problem

Per the doc of `Axis.set_ticks`:
```
        **kwargs
            `.Text` properties for the labels. These take effect only if you
            pass *labels*. In other cases, please use `~.Axes.tick_params`.
```
This means that in e.g. `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])`, the incorrect `xticklabels` silently do nothing; they are not even validated (because `labels` has not been passed).

### Proposed solution

We should at least check that `kwargs` are valid Text properties in all cases; we could even consider making any kwargs an error if `labels` is not set.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"
        result = lint(sql, rules=["L060"])
        assert len(result) == 2
    except:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    try:
        assert result[0]["description"] == "Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'."

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The test creates a figure and axes using `plt.subplots()`, then attempts to set the x-ticks with an invalid keyword argument `xticklabels` instead of `labels`.
3. **Outcome checks**:
   - If a `TypeError` is raised and the error message contains "xticklabels", it indicates that the issue has been resolved because the invalid keyword argument was caught.
   - If no error is raised or a different error is raised, it indicates that the issue is reproduced or there are other issues.
4. **Print statements**: The test prints "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues" based on the outcome.

This test can be used to verify if the issue described in the issue text has been fixed or not.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The test attempts to set xticks with an invalid `xticklabels` kwarg on the `Axes` object.
3. **Outcome Evaluation**:

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: Necessary import for `matplotlib.pyplot`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - Creates a simple plot using `plt.subplots()`.
    - Attempts to set `xticks` with invalid `kwargs` (`xticklabels=["a", "b"]`).
3. **Outcome Handling**:
    - If the `ax.set_xticks` call does not produce an error, it prints "Issue reproduced" because it indicates that the invalid `kwargs` were not validated as expected (reproducing the issue).
    - If it raises a `ValueError` and the error message contains "xticklabels", it prints "Issue resolved" because the kwargs are validated and an appropriate error is raised.
    - If there are any other issues or exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

This test should help confirm that the invalid `xticklabels` kwargs are either validated or not, depending on the outcome.

```

This test aims to reproduce and validate the issue mentioned in the issue text. Here's how it works:

1. **Necessary imports**: It imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: It creates a figure and axes, and then uses the `ax.set_xticks` method with an incorrect keyword argument (`xticklabels` instead of `labels`).
3. **Outcome handling**:
    - If no exception is thrown, it means the incorrect `xticklabels` silently did nothing, indicating the issue is reproduced.
    - If a `TypeError` is thrown and it is due to the incorrect `xticklabels`, it indicates the issue has been resolved because validation is happening.
    - If any other issue or exception occurs, it will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test can be used to verify both the presence of the issue and its resolution once the code is fixed.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Importing `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - Create a subplot using `plt.subplots()`.
   - Set xticks using `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])` to reproduce the issue.
3. **Print Statements**:
   - Print "Issue reproduced" if the `xticks` method executes without raising an error (indicating the kwargs are not being validated).
   - Print "Issue resolved" if a `TypeError` specific to invalid `Text` properties is raised, indicating the issue has been fixed.
   - Print "Other issues" if any other exceptions are raised, indicating an unrelated issue.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Only `matplotlib.pyplot` is needed for this test.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: We attempt to set xticks with an invalid kwarg `xticklabels` and verify if this leads to the silent failure as described.
3. **Outcome validation**:
   - If the incorrect `xticklabels` argument causes no exception, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If a `TypeError` with `xticklabels` in the error message is raised, indicating correct validation, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Any other exception prints "Other issues" along with the error message.
4. **Additional check**: The test also includes a case with correct kwargs to ensure it also handles valid input correctly.

This test can validate both the presence of the issue and the resolution once the code has been fixed.

        # This should raise an error or at least a warning because 'xticklabels' is not a valid kwarg for set_xticks
        ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])
        print("Issue reproduced")
    except Exception as e:

test_set_xticks_issue()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The import statement for `matplotlib.pyplot` is included, as it is necessary for creating the plot and accessing the `set_xticks` function.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: The `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])` line is used to reproduce the issue where `xticklabels` is incorrectly used and should raise an error or warning.
3. **Outcome Indications**:
   - If the code runs without raising an error, it indicates that the issue is reproduced, and it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If a `TypeError` is raised with a message that indicates `'xticklabels' is not a valid property`, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any other exception is raised or if no exception is raised when it should be, it prints "Other issues".

This test will help verify whether the issue is reproduced or resolved in the codebase.

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports:**
   - The test imports `matplotlib.pyplot` to create a plot for reproducing the issue.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - The test creates a simple plot using `plt.subplots()`.
   - The test tries to set the x-ticks using `set_xticks` with an incorrect keyword argument `xticklabels` instead of `labels`, reflecting the issue in the provided issue text.

3. **Outcome Indication:**
   - If the code runs without raising an error related to the incorrect keyword argument, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the code raises a `TypeError` indicating that `xticklabels` is an unexpected keyword argument, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the code raises any other type of error, it prints "Other issues" with the error message for further diagnosis.

4. **Test Execution:**
   - The test is encapsulated in a function `test_set_xticks_validation_issue()`, ensuring it can be executed independently.

You can run this test to determine whether the issue is still present or if it has been resolved.

This test script sets up a plot using `matplotlib` and tries to reproduce the issue by calling `set_xticks` with an invalid keyword argument `xticklabels` instead of the correct `labels`. If the issue is present, the code will run without raising an error and will print "Issue reproduced". If the problem has been resolved (i.e., the code raises an error due to invalid keyword arguments), it will print "Issue resolved" with the exception message. If any other issues arise, it will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test script performs the following actions:
1. Imports the necessary library (`matplotlib.pyplot`).
2. Creates a subplot to test the `set_xticks` method.
3. Attempts to set the `xticks` with an invalid `xticklabels` keyword argument, which should ideally raise a `TypeError` if validation is properly implemented.
4. Depending on the outcome, it prints "Issue reproduced," "Issue resolved," or "Other issues" based on the behavior encountered.

Make sure to run this script in an environment where `matplotlib` is installed. This test script can be used to verify the presence of the issue, as well as confirm if the issue gets resolved after implementing the proposed solution.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: Imported `matplotlib.pyplot` as plt.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: Attempted to use `ax.set_xticks` with the incorrect kwarg `xticklabels` without setting `labels`.
3. **Outcome Handling**:
   - If the error is raised and contains "xticklabels" in its message, it means the kwargs are being correctly validated, and "Issue resolved" is printed.
   - If no error is raised, it indicates the kwargs are not being validated properly, and "Issue reproduced" is printed.
   - For any other exceptions, "Other issues" is printed.
4. Another part of the test sets `xticks` correctly with the valid `labels` kwarg and expects no errors to confirm proper behavior. If an unexpected error occurs, it prints "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. **Imports:** Importing `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Reproduction Code:** Creating a simple plot and using the `ax.set_xticks` method with an invalid keyword argument `xticklabels` which is expected to be ignored silently (current behavior as per issue description).
3. **Validation & Print Statements:** 
   - If the code executes without raising an error, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If a `TypeError` is raised and the error message contains "xticklabels", it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If a different error is raised, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Plot Closure:** Ensuring that the plot is closed after the test.

This test will help you determine if the issue is still present or if it has been resolved, as well as identify other potential issues.

This test will attempt to use the `xticklabels` keyword argument in the `ax.set_xticks` method without providing the `labels` argument. According to the issue, this should silently fail without any validation if the issue is present. If the issue has been resolved, a `TypeError` should be raised, indicating that unexpected keyword arguments are being correctly identified. The test will print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates the issue is still present, "Issue resolved" if the issue has been fixed, and "Other issues" if there are any unexpected issues encountered.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test script imports `matplotlib.pyplot` and `matplotlib` to create a plot and set the ticks.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The script creates a plot and attempts to set the x-ticks with an incorrect `xticklabels` argument.
3. **Outcome checking**:
   - If the code runs without raising an error, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If a `TypeError` is raised and the error message contains "xticklabels", it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues".

This script tests whether the `ax.set_xticks` method correctly handles and validates the `xticklabels` argument, as described in the issue text. Running this test before and after the proposed solution is implemented will help verify if the issue has indeed been resolved.

This test will attempt to set `xticks` with an invalid `xticklabels` kwarg when the `labels` argument is not provided. According to the issue description, this should currently fail silently, indicating the issue is reproduced. If the matplotlib library is modified to validate kwargs properly and raise an error, the test will print "Issue resolved". If there are other issues or exceptions, it will print "Other issues".

### Explanation:

1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: 
    - A figure and axes are created using `plt.subplots()`.
    - `ax.set_xticks` is called with ticks but no `labels` parameter, and invalid `xticklabels` kwargs. According to the issue, this should silently do nothing and not validate the `xticklabels`.
3. **Print Statements**:
    - If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced", indicating that the invalid `xticklabels` were not validated, and the issue is present.
    - If an exception containing "kwargs" is raised, it prints "Issue resolved", indicating that the `kwargs` are being validated, and the issue is fixed.
    - If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues", indicating an unexpected error.
4. **Cleanup**: The figure is closed using `plt.close(fig)` to avoid resource leakage.

This test should help you verify if the issue is reproduced or has been resolved.

Here’s a breakdown of what this test does:
1. **Imports:** It imports the necessary `matplotlib.pyplot` module.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** It creates a basic plot and attempts to set the `xticks` with an invalid kwarg `xticklabels` without setting `labels`.
3. **Validation:** 
    - If no error is raised and xticklabels are not set, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If a `TypeError` is raised and the message contains 'xticklabels', it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If any other unexpected error occurs, it prints "Other issues".
4. **Plot Cleanup:** Ensures the plot is closed after the test to avoid resource leakage.

Explanation:
1. The script imports the necessary module, `matplotlib.pyplot`.
2. It defines the function `test_set_xticks_kwargs_validation()` which sets up a plot and intentionally uses an invalid `xticklabels` parameter with additional `fontsize` keyword argument.
3. If no error is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced" indicating that the issue is present because the incorrect kwargs are silently ignored.
4. If a `TypeError` is raised with the specific message indicating invalid kwargs, it prints "Issue resolved" indicating that the kwargs are now being validated.
5. Any other exceptions are caught and reported with the message "Other issues".

This test can reproduce the issue as described and can also verify if the issue has been resolved.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Only `matplotlib.pyplot` is required since we are dealing with `Axes.set_xticks`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: 
    - The first part of the test tries to use `ax.set_xticks` with an invalid keyword argument `xticklabels` which should ideally be flagged. If it passes without error, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
    - The second part validates if valid `Text` property kwargs like `color` are applied correctly when `labels` are provided.
3. **Outcome-based Print Statements**:
    - `"Issue reproduced"`: Printed if invalid kwargs are accepted without error.
    - `"Issue resolved"`: Printed if invalid kwargs are properly flagged and valid kwargs work fine.
    - `"Other issues"`: Printed if any unexpected exceptions or issues arise.

Certainly! Here is a complete test to reproduce the issue described in the issue text:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.axes import Axes

def test_axes_set_xticks():
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    
    try:
        # This line should cause an issue as described in the problem
        ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])
        
        # If no exception is raised, we need to check if the labels are set or kwargs are validated
        if ax.get_xticklabels()[0].get_text() != "a":

        else:
            print("Issue resolved")

        # If any other exception occurs
        print(f"Other issues: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_axes_set_xticks()
```

Explanation of the test:
1. **Necessary Imports**: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and `from matplotlib.axes import Axes`.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**: `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])`.
3. **Outcome Checks**:
   - `ax.get_xticklabels()[0].get_text() != "a"`: Checks if the tick label was set incorrectly, which reproduces the issue.
   - If the issue is resolved (`ax.get_xticklabels()[0].get_text() == "a"`), it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any unexpected exception occurs during the test, it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.

Please note that in the current state as per the issue, the `xticklabels` parameter is not valid for `set_xticks`. If the behavior changes to validate kwargs or throw an error for invalid kwargs, this test will help in verifying that.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: Import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: Create a figure and axis using `plt.subplots()`. Try to set xticks with `ax.set_xticks` using an invalid kwarg (`invalid_kwarg="should_fail"`) without setting labels.
3. **Outcome checks**:
    - If no exception is raised, it indicates that the invalid kwarg was not validated and the issue is reproduced.
    - If a `TypeError` is raised and the error message contains "invalid_kwarg", it indicates that kwargs are now being validated properly, hence the issue is resolved.
    - Any other exception or error message suggests other issues with the source code.
4. **Print statements**: Depending on the outcomes, print "Issue reproduced", "Issue resolved", or "Other issues".

This test will help in verifying whether the invalid kwargs are being properly checked even when labels are not set.

4. If the code executes without raising an error, it prints "Issue reproduced."
5. If a `TypeError` is raised with a specific message indicating unexpected keyword arguments, it prints "Issue resolved."
6. If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues" and the exception message.
7. We ensure the figure is closed at the end with `plt.close(fig)` to avoid any resource leaks.

test_set_xticks_validation()
```

This test will check if the incorrect `xticklabels` argument in the `ax.set_xticks` method raises a TypeError. If it does not, the issue is reproduced, indicating that `kwargs` are not validated properly. If a specific TypeError about `xticklabels` is raised, it indicates the issue has been resolved. Any other exceptions will be categorized as other issues.

test_set_xticks_validation()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The code creates a figure and an axis using `plt.subplots()`. It then attempts to set the x-ticks using `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])` without providing the `labels` argument. According to the issue, this should silently fail.
3. **Outcome checking**:
   - If no exception is raised, it prints `"Issue reproduced"` indicating that the issue is still present.
   - If a `TypeError` is raised and it includes 'xticklabels' in the error message, it prints `"Issue resolved"`, indicating the issue has been fixed by validating the `xticklabels`.
   - For any other exceptions, it prints `"Other issues"` with the exception message to indicate there might be other problems.

This test can be used to verify both the presence and resolution of the issue described.

```

This test script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary modules.
2. Creates a figure and axes using `plt.subplots()`.
3. Tries to set the x-ticks with invalid keyword arguments (`xticklabels` instead of `labels`).
4. If a `TypeError` is raised, it prints "Issue resolved" because that means the validation has been done correctly and the kwargs are not silently ignored.
5. If any other exception is raised, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.
6. If no exception is raised, it prints "Issue reproduced" because it means the issue is still present and the invalid keyword arguments were silently ignored.
