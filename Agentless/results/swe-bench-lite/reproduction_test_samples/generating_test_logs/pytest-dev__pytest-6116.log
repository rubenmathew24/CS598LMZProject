--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
pytest --collect-only needs a one char shortcut command
I find myself needing to run `--collect-only` very often and that cli argument is a very long to type one. 

I do think that it would be great to allocate a character for it, not sure which one yet. Please use up/down thumbs to vote if you would find it useful or not and eventually proposing which char should be used. 

Clearly this is a change very easy to implement but first I want to see if others would find it useful or not.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The `subprocess` module is imported to run shell commands from within the Python script.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The script first runs `pytest --collect-only` and checks if the output contains the word "collected", which indicates that the collection process was successful.
   - If the collection information is present, it prints "Issue reproduced".
3. **Verification of the fix**:
   - The script then runs `pytest -c` (assuming `-c` is the proposed shortcut for `--collect-only`).
   - It checks if the output contains the word "collected".
   - If the collection information is present, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. **Handling other issues**:
   - If any exceptions occur or if the expected output is not found, it prints "Other issues".

This test script can be used to verify if the proposed shortcut for `--collect-only` has been implemented and works correctly.

Certainly! Below is the complete test code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text regarding the `--collect-only` command in `pytest`. This test will attempt to run `pytest --collect-only` and check for the expected behavior. 

The test will:
1. Reproduce the issue if no short flag is available.
2. Verify if the issue is resolved by checking the existence of a new short flag for `--collect-only`.
3. Print "Other issues" for any unforeseen errors.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut():
    # Define the long and hypothetical short flags
    long_flag = "--collect-only"
    short_flag = "-c"  # Assume '-c' as the desired short flag for this example

    # Function to run pytest with a flag and return the result
    def run_pytest_with_flag(flag):
        try:
            result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", flag, "--disable-warnings"], capture_output=True, text=True)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Other issues: {e}")
            return None

    # Run pytest with the long flag
    result_long = run_pytest_with_flag(long_flag)
    if result_long is None or result_long.returncode != 0:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    # Run pytest with the short flag
    result_short = run_pytest_with_flag(short_flag)

    if result_short is None:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    if result_short.returncode == 0:
        print("Issue resolved")
    else:
        print("Issue reproduced")

test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut()
```

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Import necessary modules (`subprocess` to run commands and `sys` to get the current Python executable).
2. **Function Definition**: Define `test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut` to handle the test logic.
3. **Flag Definitions**: Define the long (`--collect-only`) and hypothetical short (`-c`) flags for the test.
4. **Helper Function**: `run_pytest_with_flag` runs `pytest` with the given flag and captures its output.
5. **Run Tests**: Execute `pytest` with both the long and short flags.
6. **Check Results**: Print "Issue resolved" if the short flag works (`returncode` is `0`), otherwise print "Issue reproduced".
7. **Error Handling**: Catch and print any unforeseen errors as "Other issues".

This test script will help verify the existence of a short flag for `--collect-only` and check if it has been implemented correctly.

Sure, let's create a test based on the issue described. The issue is about the lack of a one-character shortcut for the `pytest --collect-only` command. We'll create a test that checks if the `--collect-only` option has a one-character shortcut or not.

Here's the complete test:

```python
import subprocess

def test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut() -> None:
    # Attempt to run pytest with `-c`, the proposed shortcut for `--collect-only`
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['pytest', '-c'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Other issues")
        return

    # Check if the output contains any references to the `--collect-only` option
    if '--collect-only' in result.stderr or '--collect-only' in result.stdout:
        print("Issue resolved")
    else:
        print("Issue reproduced")

test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut()
```

This test does the following:
1. Attempts to run `pytest` with the `-c` option as a shortcut for `--collect-only`.
2. Captures the output and checks if the `--collect-only` option is recognized when the `-c` option is used.
3. Prints "Issue resolved" if the `--collect-only` option is recognized, meaning the shortcut works.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the `--collect-only` option is not recognized, meaning the shortcut does not work.
5. Prints "Other issues" if there are other issues with running the command, such as a subprocess error.

You can run this test to verify if the one-character shortcut for `--collect-only` has been implemented. Adjust the shortcut character (`-c` in this case) as needed based on the final decision.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import `subprocess` for running command-line processes within the test.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - We define the long option `--collect-only` and a proposed short option (e.g., `-c`).
    - We run `pytest` with the `--collect-only` option and check if it executes without errors.
    - We then run `pytest` with the proposed short option and check if it also executes without errors.
3. **Print statements**:
    - If either command fails or an unexpected error occurs, we print "Other issues".
    - We compare the outputs of the two commands. If they match, it indicates that the short option works as intended, and we print "Issue resolved". If they do not match, it indicates that the issue is reproduced, and we print "Issue reproduced".

### Note:
The short option character (`-c` in this case) is just a placeholder. You should choose an appropriate character that doesn't conflict with other existing options in `pytest`. This test assumes that the implementation for the short option is already done; otherwise, the test will print "Issue reproduced".

To use this test:
1. Ensure you have `pytest` installed in your environment.
2. Save the test script in a `.py` file.
3. Run the script to see if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

This script assumes that `-c` is chosen as the shortcut for `--collect-only`. If a different shortcut is chosen, replace `-c` with the appropriate character. The script will run `pytest` with both the long and short versions of the `--collect-only` argument and compare their outputs to verify if the shortcut works correctly.

This test script:
1. Ensures `pytest` is installed by checking its version.
2. Verifies that the `--collect-only` argument works as expected.
3. Attempts to use a hypothetical shortcut command for `--collect-only`. If the shortcut is recognized and works, it prints "Issue resolved"; otherwise, it prints "Issue reproduced".

Note: The shortcut command `-c` is used as a placeholder. You should replace it with the actual shortcut character that will be implemented for the `--collect-only` argument.

This test script does the following:
1. Imports the necessary `pytest` and `subprocess` modules.
2. Defines a test function `test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut`.
3. Runs the `pytest --collect-only` command and captures its output.
4. Runs the `pytest -c` command (assuming `-c` as the proposed shortcut) and captures its output.
5. Compares the outputs of the two commands.
6. Prints "Issue resolved" if the outputs are the same.

If `-c` works and the output shows the expected behavior (i.e., the presence of the word "collected"), it will print "Issue resolved". If the shortcut doesn't work, it will print "Issue reproduced". Any other unexpected issues will print "Other issues".

You should replace `-c` with whatever single-character shortcut you decide to use if you implement this feature.

4. **Handling other issues**: If the `pytest` command fails or any exception occurs, it prints "Other issues".

This test should help verify if the issue about the long `--collect-only` argument is reproduced or if it has been resolved by implementing a shortcut.

- We then attempt to run the proposed short command `pytest -c` (assuming `-c` is the chosen shortcut) and compare its output with the output of the long command.
- If the output of both commands matches and includes the expected "collected" text, we confirm that the issue is resolved.

Please note that in order for the test to pass, the implementation of the one-character shortcut (`-c` in this case) needs to be done in the `pytest` tool. If this shortcut hasn't yet been implemented, running this test will help confirm the need for its addition by reproducing the issue.

Explanation:
1. Import `subprocess` to run shell commands from within the Python script.
2. Define `test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut()` to test the behavior of `--collect-only` and the proposed shortcut.
3. Use `subprocess.run()` to execute `pytest --collect-only` and capture the output.
4. Check if the output contains the word 'collected', indicating that `--collect-only` was executed correctly and print "Issue reproduced".
5. Define a placeholder command (`['pytest', '-c']`) for the shortcut (assuming `-c` as the shortcut for this example).
6. Run the shortcut command and check if it produces the expected result.
7. Print "Issue resolved" if the shortcut works or "Other issues" if it doesn't match the expected behavior.
8. Handle potential exceptions and print "Other issues" if any unexpected errors occur.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Only the necessary `subprocess` and `sys` modules are imported.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - The function `run_command` executes a shell command and captures its output.
    - The `test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut` function runs `pytest --collect-only` and captures the output.
    - It then runs `pytest -c` (assuming `-c` is the proposed shortcut) and captures the output.
3. **Outcome Handling**:

    - If they produce different outputs or any command fails, it prints "Issue reproduced" or "Other issues".

Note: The proposed shortcut `-c` is a placeholder. The actual character should be determined by the community or the developers.

```

### Explanation
1. **Necessary imports:** The `subprocess` module is imported to run shell commands from within the Python script.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:**
   - The script first runs the pytest command with the full `--collect-only` argument.
   - It then attempts to run pytest with a hypothetical one-character shortcut `-c` (assuming `-c` would be chosen as the shortcut).
3. **Outcome checks:**
   - If the command with the full argument fails, it means there are other issues unrelated to the specific problem described in the issue text.
   - If the command with the shortcut fails, the issue is reproduced, indicating that the shortcut is not implemented.
   - If both commands succeed and produce the same output, it indicates the issue is resolved (assuming the shortcut `-c` has been implemented).
   - If there are any discrepancies or exceptions, it means there are other issues.

This test will help confirm whether the implementation of a one-character shortcut for `--collect-only` has been successfully made and behaves as expected.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import the `subprocess` module to run shell commands from within the test.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The script runs the `pytest --collect-only` command to collect tests.
3. **Outcome check**:
   - If the command runs successfully and the output indicates tests were collected, print "Issue reproduced".
   - If another issue is encountered (e.g., pytest error or no tests collected), print "Other issues".
4. **Shortcut suggestion**: For the sake of this test, we assume a hypothetical shortcut `-c` for `--collect-only` and check if it works similarly.
5. **Resolution check**:
   - If the shortcut command works and collects tests, print "Issue resolved".
   - Otherwise, print "Issue reproduced" again.

This test is designed to check if the `--collect-only` command is unwieldy and validates if a hypothetical shortcut would solve the problem. Adjust the shortcut flag as necessary when implementing the actual solution.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: We import `pytest` and `subprocess` to run the necessary pytest commands and capture their output.
2. **Primary Test Function**: The function `test_shortcut_for_collect_only` tests both the existing `--collect-only` argument and a hypothetical shortcut (proposed as `-c` in this script).
3. **First Command**: 
   - We run `pytest --collect-only` to check the current behavior and ensure it works as expected.
   - If the command succeeds and the word "collected" appears in the output, we print "Issue resolved". 
   - Otherwise, we print "Other issues".
4. **Second Command**: 
   - We attempt to run `pytest -c` to simulate the proposed shortcut.
   - If the command succeeds and the word "collected" appears in the output, we print "Issue resolved".
   - If it fails or doesn't produce the expected output, we print "Issue reproduced".
5. **Error Handling**: Any exceptions caught during the subprocess execution will print "Other issues".

This script allows you to validate both the current and proposed behavior, ensuring that the issue is both reproducible and verifiable once fixed.

2. Assumes a shortcut `-c` has been added for `--collect-only` and runs `pytest -c`.
3. Compares the output of both commands to ensure they produce the same result.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the issue is present.
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if the issue has been fixed.
6. Prints "Other issues" if there are any other problems with the source code or execution.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** The script imports the `subprocess` module to run shell commands.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:**
   - The script first runs `pytest --collect-only` command to see the current behavior.
   - It captures the output and checks if it contains information about collected tests.
3. **Assertions and Outcome:**
   - The script then runs a hypothetical short command (`pytest -c`).
   - It compares the output of the short command to the output of the `--collect-only` command.
4. **Print Statements:**
   - If the outputs match, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If the outputs do not match or an error occurs, it prints "Issue reproduced" or "Other issues" as appropriate.

This script can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify if it has been fixed.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**: The test imports the `subprocess` module to run shell commands from within the Python script.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
    - The script runs `pytest --collect-only` and checks if the output contains "collected".
    - It then runs the hypothetical `pytest -c` (assuming `-c` is the chosen shortcut) to check if the output is similar.
3. **Outcome Messages**:
    - Prints "Issue resolved" if the output matches for both long and short commands.
    - Prints "Issue reproduced" if the short command does not produce the expected outcome.
    - Prints "Other issues" if there are other exceptions or unexpected behavior.

This test will help identify if the shortcut for `--collect-only` is functioning as intended once implemented.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:** We import `subprocess` to run shell commands from within Python.
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:** We use `subprocess.run` to execute `pytest --collect-only` and `pytest -c`.
   - `result1` runs with `--collect-only`.
   - `result2` runs with the proposed shortcut `-c`.
3. **Print Output:**
   - If `result1` or `result2` return a non-zero exit code, it suggests other issues.
   - If the shortcut command `-c` is not yet implemented, it will produce an error, indicating the issue is reproduced.
   - If both commands succeed and produce the same output, the shortcut is implemented, indicating the issue is resolved.
   - If either command fails or produces different output, other issues are indicated.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports:**
   - We import `subprocess` to run shell commands from within the Python script.
   
2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue:**
   - We run the `pytest --collect-only` command and check if it runs successfully.
   - Then, we attempt to use a shortcut (in this example, `-c`) to see if it performs the same function.
   
3. **Outcome Handling:**
   - If the command without the shortcut fails or has issues, it prints "Other issues."
   - If the shortcut command fails, it prints "Issue reproduced," indicating that the shortcut does not exist or does not work.
   - If the shortcut command works, it prints "Issue resolved," indicating that the issue has been fixed.

Feel free to adjust the shortcut character according to the one you eventually decide to implement. This script will help you verify the existence of a shortcut and its functionality.

2. Runs the full `--collect-only` command to check the existing functionality.
3. Checks for potential short aliases (e.g., `-c` and `-C`) for `--collect-only`.
4. Prints "Issue reproduced" if neither alias works (indicating the shortcut does not exist).
5. Prints "Issue resolved" if either alias works.
6. Prints "Other issues" if there are any errors or unexpected behaviors during execution.

This test can be used to verify whether a shortcut command for `--collect-only` has been implemented or if the issue still persists.

This test script does the following:

1. Runs `pytest --collect-only` and captures its output.
2. Runs `pytest -c` (assuming `-c` might be the proposed shortcut) and captures its output.
3. Compares the outputs of the two commands.
4. Prints "Issue resolved" if the outputs are the same, indicating that the shortcut behaves identically to the long argument.
5. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the outputs differ, indicating that the shortcut is not correctly implemented or not available.
6. Prints "Other issues" if there is a problem executing either of the commands.

def test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut():

    elif result.returncode == 0:
        print("Issue resolved")
    else:

test_pytest_collect_only_shortcut()
```

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
    - `subprocess`: To run the command line `pytest` command within the test.
  
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - We run `pytest --collect-only` using `subprocess.run`.
    - We capture the output and check for the presence of the string `--collect-only` in the result's output to determine if the issue is reproduced.
  
3. **Print statements**:
    - "Issue reproduced": If the string `--collect-only` is in the result output, it means the issue is reproduced because we had to type the full `--collect-only`.
    - "Issue resolved": If the return code of the command is `0` and no `--collect-only` is present in the output, it means a short command has been implemented and the issue is resolved.
    - "Other issues": If neither condition is met, there are other issues with the source code or the pytest command.

This test should help you identify if the issue is reproduced or resolved after any change made to the pytest command to introduce a one-character shortcut for `--collect-only`.

Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Only `subprocess` is imported to handle the command-line execution of `pytest`.
2. **Reproduction**: 
   - The test first runs `pytest --collect-only` to check if it successfully collects the test items.
   - If "collected" is found in the stdout output, it confirms that `pytest --collect-only` works as expected.
3. **Shortcut Verification**:
   - The test then runs `pytest -c` to check if the hypothetical shortcut for `--collect-only` is implemented.
   - If "unrecognized arguments: -c" is in the stderr output, it indicates that the shortcut is not implemented, which reproduces the issue.
   - Otherwise, if it doesn't throw an error, it indicates the issue has been resolved.
4. **Exception Handling**: Any exceptions encountered during the subprocess execution are caught and reported as "Other issues".

This test will help verify both the presence of the issue and its resolution.
