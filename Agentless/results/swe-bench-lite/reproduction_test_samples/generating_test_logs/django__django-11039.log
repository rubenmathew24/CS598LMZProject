--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
sqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL
Description
	 
		(last modified by Simon Charette)
	 
The migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT ​if the migration is atomic and ​the schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.
The issue can be addressed by
Changing sqlmigrate ​assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.
Adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on ​an existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.
I marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.

--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python

Essential Django imports to set up the test case and run management commands.\n    - `patch` from `unittest.mock` to simulate `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` being `False`.\n\n2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:\n    - The `setUp` method is provided to set initial conditions if necessary.\n    - The `test_sqlmigrate_output` method:\n        - Uses `call_command` to create a migration file.\n        - Uses `call_command` again to capture the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.\n        - Checks the generated SQL for `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements.\n\n3. **Outcome checks**:\n    - If `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;` is found in the SQL output, it prints "Issue reproduced".\n    - If not, it prints "Issue resolved".\n    - If any other exceptions occur, it catches them and prints "Other issues" along with the exception message. \n\n### Usage:\n- This code sets up a Django test case to check if the `sqlmigrate` command improperly includes `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements when `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is `False`.\n- You can run this script in the context of your Django project to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

2. We create a test case `TestSQLMigrateTransactionHandling` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
3. We use the `patch` decorator to mock the `can_rollback_ddl` feature to `False`.
4. Inside the test method `test_sqlmigrate_non_transactional_ddl`, we mock a migration's `atomic` attribute to `False`.
5. We redirect the output of the `sqlmigrate` command to capture it.
6. We call the `sqlmigrate` command for a mock migration.
7. We check if the output contains "BEGIN;" or "COMMIT;" and print "Issue reproduced" if it does, otherwise "Issue resolved".
8. Any exceptions will lead to printing "Other issues".

This test can be run to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved.

This test performs the following steps:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Defines a `TestCase` subclass to encapsulate the test logic.
3. Mocks the `can_rollback_ddl` feature of the database connection to `False`.
4. Generates an empty migration file for the specified app (`your_app_name`).
5. Captures the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.
6. Checks for the presence of `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements in the generated SQL.
7. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the statements are found, "Issue resolved" if they are not, and "Other issues" if any unexpected exceptions occur.

Make sure to replace `'your_app_name'` with the actual name of the app you are testing.

Explanation:
1. **Imports and Setup:** We import necessary modules including `unittest` for the test case framework and `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock the `can_rollback_ddl` feature.
2. **Mocking Non-Transactional DDL:** Using `patch`, we set `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate an environment where the database does not support transactional DDL.
3. **Running `sqlmigrate` Command:** We run the `sqlmigrate` management command and capture its output.
4. **Checking for BEGIN/COMMIT Statements:** We check the output for `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements:
   - If present, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If absent, it prints "Issue resolved".

This test should help verify whether the `sqlmigrate` command correctly respects the `can_rollback_ddl` feature in addition to the `migration.atomic` setting. Adjust `"app"` and `"0001_initial"` to fit your actual app and migration names.

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The test imports the needed modules, including `unittest` and `unittest.mock`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The test mocks a `MigrationExecutor` and sets `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`.
   - It captures the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.
3. **Print statements for outcomes**:
   - If `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` are present in the output, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` are not present, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Other issues".

The test checks if the sqlmigrate command's output includes transaction statements (`BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;`), which should not be the case for databases that don't support transactional DDL when `can_rollback_ddl` is `False`.

        else:
            print("Issue resolved")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Here's a summary of what the test does:
1. **Necessary imports**:
   - It uses `unittest` for creating the test case.
   - `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.
   - `call_command` from `django.core.management` to capture the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.
   - `StringIO` from `io` to capture and manipulate the command's output.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - A test case `SqlMigrateTestCase` is created.
   - It contains a single test method `test_non_transactional_ddl`.
   - The test mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate a database that doesn't support transactional DDL.
   - It captures the output of the `sqlmigrate` command for a fake migration.

3. **Outcome determination**:
   - If the output contains `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;`, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
   - Otherwise, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If there's any exception, it prints "Other issues".

To execute this test, ensure you have a Django app named `yourapp` and a migration named `0001_initial` or adjust the `app_label` and `migration_name` accordingly.

Explanation:
1. Imports: We import necessary modules and classes from Django and unittest for mocking.
2. Test Case Setup: We define a test case class using `TestCase`.
3. Override Database Settings: We use `@override_settings` to set up an SQLite database for testing, mimicking the environment.
4. Mocking can_rollback_ddl: We mock the `can_rollback_ddl` feature to `False` to simulate a database that does not support transactional DDL.
5. Creating a Migration: We use `call_command` with `makemigrations` to create a minimal migration for our test application.
6. Capturing Output: We capture the output of the `sqlmigrate` command to inspect it for `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements.
7. Output Evaluation: We check if the output contains `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;` and print "Issue reproduced" if it does, otherwise print "Issue resolved". Any exceptions encountered will print "Other issues" along with the exception message.

This test will help you identify if the issue described occurs and verify if a fix resolves it.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports:**
   - `unittest`: For structuring the test.
   - `patch` from `unittest.mock`: To mock the `can_rollback_ddl` feature.
   - `call_command` from `django.core.management`: To call the `sqlmigrate` command.
   - `connection` from `django.db`: To access the database connection features.
   - `StringIO` from `io`: To capture the command output.

2. **Test Class and Method:**
   - `TestSqlMigrateTransaction`: A class inheriting from `unittest.TestCase`.
   - `test_sqlmigrate_transactional_ddl`: The test method.
   - Uses `patch` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate the database not supporting transactional DDL.
   - Calls `sqlmigrate` command for a specific migration (`'0001_initial'` as an example; replace it with your actual migration file).
   - Captures the standard output and checks if it starts with "BEGIN;" and ends with "COMMIT;".

3. **Output Conditions:**
   - If the output is wrapped in `BEGIN/COMMIT`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the output is not wrapped in `BEGIN/COMMIT`, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" with the exception message.

Replace `'yourappname'` and `'0001_initial'` with your actual app name and the migration file you want to test. This script should help you verify whether the issue described in the issue text is reproducible and if it has been resolved or not.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: 
    - Mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate a database that doesn't support transactional DDL.
    - Call the `sqlmigrate` command with a sample migration (e.g., `0001_initial` for `testapp`).
    - Capture the output of the command.
3. **Print statements to verify outcomes**:
    - If the output contains `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;`, it indicates the issue is reproduced.
    - If the output doesn't contain `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;`, it indicates the issue is resolved.
    - If any other exception occurs, it indicates other issues.

This test should be able to reproduce the described issue when the problem exists and verify that the issue has been resolved once the fix is applied.

This test covers the scenario described in the issue:

1. It uses `unittest` and `unittest.mock` for structuring the test and mocking necessary parts.
2. It patches `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to be `False` to simulate a database that does not support transactional DDL.
3. It creates a mock migration marked as non-atomic.
4. It patches the `MigrationLoader.get_migration` method to return the mock migration.
5. It runs the `sqlmigrate` command and checks if the output contains any `BEGIN` or `COMMIT` statements.
6. It prints `Issue resolved` if the transactions are correctly omitted, `Issue reproduced` if they are incorrectly included, and `Other issues` for any other unexpected output.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The script imports necessary modules from Django for testing, database connection handling, and unittest for testing.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The `setUp` method configures the minimum necessary Django settings for testing.
   - The `test_sqlmigrate_output` method uses the `call_command` method to run the `sqlmigrate` command for a specific migration (`0001_initial` in this case). 
   - The test mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate a database that doesn't support transactional DDL.
3. **Outcome conditions**:
   - If the output contains "BEGIN;" and "COMMIT;", it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If not, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any other exceptions arise, it prints "Other issues" and the exception details.

Make sure to replace `'your_app'` and `'0001_initial'` with the appropriate names for your project and migrations. Run this script in an environment where Django is properly set up and has access to your migration files.

This code sets up a unit test for the issue described. It mocks the database connection to simulate a scenario where the database does not support transactional DDL. It then calls the `sqlmigrate` command to check if the output incorrectly contains `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements. The test will print "Issue reproduced" if the issue is still present and "Issue resolved" if the issue has been addressed. If any other issues are encountered, it will print "Other issues".

Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: We import necessary modules such as `unittest`, `patch` from `unittest.mock`, `call_command` from `django.core.management`, and `connection` from `django.db`. We also import `StringIO` to capture output from the command.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: We use `unittest.TestCase` to create a test case. The `@patch` decorator is used to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`.
3. **Print statements**:
   - If an exception occurs during `call_command`, it prints "Other issues".
   - After capturing the output, it checks if the output contains `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;`. If found, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Issue resolved".
4. **Run the test**: The test is executed when the script is run as the main module.

This test case should help in verifying if the `sqlmigrate` command incorrectly includes `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements when `can_rollback_ddl` is `False`.

Sure, here is a complete test script to reproduce and verify the issue as described in the issue text:

```python
import io
import sys
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.db import connection
from django.test import TestCase
from unittest.mock import patch

class SqlMigrateTestCase(TestCase):
    
    @patch('django.db.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl', False)
    def test_sqlmigrate_output_transaction(self):
        # Redirect stdout to capture the output of the sqlmigrate command
        old_stdout = sys.stdout
        new_stdout = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = new_stdout
        
        try:
            # Call the sqlmigrate command for a known migration
            call_command('sqlmigrate', 'app_name', '0001_initial')
            output = new_stdout.getvalue()

            sys.stdout = old_stdout

# Execute the test case
if __name__ == "__main__":
    SqlMigrateTestCase().test_sqlmigrate_output_transaction()
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Defines a test case class `SqlMigrateTestCase` which inherits from `TestCase`.
3. Uses `unittest.mock.patch` to mock the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` attribute to `False`.
4. Redirects `stdout` to capture the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.
5. Calls the `sqlmigrate` command to generate SQL for a known migration (`app_name` and `0001_initial` should be replaced with actual values from your project).
6. Checks if the output contains `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements to determine if the issue is reproduced.
7. Prints "Issue reproduced" if the output contains `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;`, otherwise prints "Issue resolved".
8. Catches any exceptions and prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.
9. Resets `stdout` to its original value.

Replace `app_name` and `0001_initial` with appropriate values from your project to make this test applicable.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary Imports**:
   - `unittest`: For creating the test case.
   - `patch`: For mocking the `can_rollback_ddl` feature.
   - `call_command`: To execute the `sqlmigrate` management command.
   - `connection`: To access the database connection settings.
   - `StringIO`: To capture the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.

2. **Code to Reproduce the Issue**:
   - We are using `unittest.TestCase` class to define our test case.
   - We mock the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute to `False` using `patch`.
   - We execute the `sqlmigrate` management command to generate SQL for the migration using `call_command`.
   - We capture the output using `StringIO`.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - We check if the output contains `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;` statements.
   - If it does, we print "Issue reproduced".
   - If it does not, we print "Issue resolved".
   - Any exceptions during the process will print "Other issues" followed by the exception message.

4. **Execution**:
   - To run the test, you need to execute the script. The test framework will handle the setup and invocation of the test method.

Make sure to update `app_label` and `migration_label` with appropriate values from your Django project to ensure the test runs correctly.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**: The code imports required modules and functions such as `unittest`, `patch` for mocking, `call_command` for running management commands, and `connection` from `django.db`.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**: The `test_sqlmigrate_transaction_handling` function sets up a mock for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to return `False` to simulate a database that does not support transactional DDL.

3. **Running the command**: The `call_command` function runs the `sqlmigrate` command on a specific migration (`0001_initial` for the app `yourappname`). Adjust `yourappname` and the migration name accordingly.

4. **Checking the output**: The code captures the output of the command and checks for the presence of `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements.

5. **Outcome messages**: Based on the presence of these statements, it prints "Issue reproduced" if the current behavior is incorrect, "Issue resolved" if the fix is effective, or "Other issues" if any unexpected error occurs.

### Usage:
Replace `yourappname` and `0001_initial` with the correct app name and migration name within your project. Run the test to verify if the issue described is reproduced or resolved.

Certainly! Below is the complete test to reproduce the issue as described in the issue text. This test will check if `sqlmigrate` incorrectly wraps its output in `BEGIN/COMMIT` statements even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL.

```python
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.db import connection
from io import StringIO
import sys

def test_sqlmigrate_output():
    # Redirect stdout to capture the output of the sqlmigrate command
    old_stdout = sys.stdout
    sys.stdout = mystdout = StringIO()

    # Mock the connection features to simulate a database that doesn't support transactional DDL
    connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False

    try:
        # Call the sqlmigrate command on a sample migration
        call_command('sqlmigrate', 'your_app_label', '0001_initial')

        # Get the sqlmigrate output
        output = mystdout.getvalue()

    finally:
        # Reset stdout
        sys.stdout = old_stdout

test_sqlmigrate_output()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports:** The test imports necessary modules such as `call_command` from `django.core.management`, `connection` from `django.db`, and `StringIO` from `io`.
2. **Code to reproduce the issue:** 
   - Redirects `stdout` to capture the output of `sqlmigrate`.
   - Mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate the environment described in the issue.
   - Calls `sqlmigrate` on a sample migration (replace `'your_app_label'` and `'0001_initial'` with appropriate values for your project).
3. **Print statements for outcomes:**
   - If the output contains `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;`, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If the output does not contain these statements, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - If any other error occurs, it prints "Other issues" along with the exception message.

Make sure to replace `'your_app_label'` and `'0001_initial'` with actual values corresponding to your application's migration files. This test should help in confirming the presence or resolution of the described issue.

In this test:
1. We mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate a scenario where the database doesn't support transactional DDL.
2. We run the `sqlmigrate` command for a sample migration.
3. We check if the output unnecessarily includes `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;`.
4. Depending on the output, we print whether the issue is reproduced, resolved, or if there are other issues.

Replace `'yourapp'` and `'0001_initial'` with your actual app name and migration file. This will help to reproduce and verify the issue as described.

2. Mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate a database that does not support transactional DDL.
3. Uses `call_command` to simulate running `sqlmigrate` on an example app with a specific migration.
4. Captures the output and checks if it contains `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;`.

This test will print:
- "Issue reproduced" if `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` are incorrectly present in the output.
- "Issue resolved" if they are not present.
- "Other issues" if there are other problems when running the command.

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: Necessary Django, testing utilities, and patching tools are imported at the start.
2. **Test Case Class**: A `TestCase` class is defined which includes the method to test the `sqlmigrate` command.
3. **Override Settings**: The `override_settings` decorator is used to point Django to use a specific migration module.
4. **Mocking Database Features**: The `patch` decorator is used to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to simulate a database that does not support transactional DDL.
5. **Create Dummy Migration**: The `makemigrations` command is run to create a dummy migration for testing.
6. **Capture Output**: The standard output is patched to capture the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.
7. **Check Output**: The captured output is checked for `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements. Depending on the presence of these statements, the appropriate message is printed.
8. **Handling Exceptions**: Any exceptions during the test run lead to printing "Other issues" along with the exception message.

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**: Necessary imports including `pytest`, `call_command` for running the management command, `connection` for database connection, `mock` for mocking features, and `StringIO` for capturing command output.
2. **Mocking**: The `can_rollback_ddl` feature is mocked to `False` to simulate a database that doesn't support transactional DDL.
3. **Command Execution**: The test runs the `sqlmigrate` command with a sample migration (`'app_name', '0001_initial'`). The output is captured using `StringIO`.
4. **Checking Output**: The output is checked for `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;` statements. If these statements are present, it indicates the issue is reproduced. If not, the issue is resolved.
5. **Outcome Messages**: The test prints "Issue reproduced" if BEGIN/COMMIT are found, "Issue resolved" if not, and "Other issues" if any unexpected exceptions occur. 

Replace `'app_name'` and `'0001_initial'` with actual values from your project for the test to be accurate.

3. **Patching**: The `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is patched to return `False` to mimic the scenario where the database does not support transactional DDL. The `handle` method of the `sqlmigrate` command is also patched to capture and simulate the output.
4. **Test Method**: The `test_sqlmigrate_respects_transactional_ddl` method runs the `sqlmigrate` command, capturing its output.
5. **Assertions**: The method checks if the output contains `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements:
   - If both are present, it prints "Issue reproduced".
   - If neither is present, it prints "Issue resolved".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Other issues".
6. **Mock Handle Method**: The `_mock_handle_side_effect` method simulates the SQL output of the `sqlmigrate` command.
7. **Main Execution**: The test is executed if the script is run directly.

This test should be adapted to your actual environment and modified as necessary to fit your codebase and specific requirements.

Explanation:

1. **Imports:** Necessary imports include `mock` for mocking the `can_rollback_ddl` attribute, `call_command` to invoke the `sqlmigrate` management command, and other Django testing utilities.
2. **Mocking `can_rollback_ddl`:** Using `mock.patch` to temporarily set `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`.
3. **Redirecting Output:** Redirecting the output of the `sqlmigrate` command to a `StringIO` buffer.
4. **Calling `sqlmigrate`:** Invoking the `sqlmigrate` command with an example app label and migration name.
5. **Checking Output:** Checking if the output contains `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` to determine if the issue is reproduced or resolved.
6. **Printing Results:** Printing "Issue reproduced" if `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` are found in the output, "Issue resolved" if not, and "Other issues" if other errors occur.

Replace `"app_label"` and `"migration_name"` with actual values relevant to your project before running the test.

# Run the test case
if __name__ == "__main__":

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
    - Essential Django imports to set up the test case and run management commands.
    - `patch` from `unittest.mock` to simulate `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` being `False`.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
    - The `setUp` method is provided to set initial conditions if necessary.
    - The `test_sqlmigrate_output` method:
        - Uses `call_command` to create a migration file.
        - Uses `call_command` again to capture the output of the `sqlmigrate` command.
        - Checks the generated SQL for `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements.

3. **Outcome checks**:
    - If `BEGIN;` or `COMMIT;` is found in the SQL output, it prints "Issue reproduced".
    - If not, it prints "Issue resolved".
    - If any other exceptions occur, it catches them and prints "Other issues" along with the exception message. 

### Usage:
- This code sets up a Django test case to check if the `sqlmigrate` command improperly includes `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` statements when `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is `False`.
- You can run this script in the context of your Django project to verify if the issue is reproduced or resolved. Make sure to replace `'myapp'` with the relevant app name in your project.

### Explanation:
1. **Necessary imports**:
   - `unittest`: Python's built-in unit testing framework.
   - `patch`: A decorator from `unittest.mock` to mock specific features.
   - `call_command`: To call the `sqlmigrate` management command.
   - `connection`: To access database connection features.
   - `StringIO`: To capture command output.

2. **Code to reproduce the issue**:
   - The test case mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` to simulate a database that doesn’t support transactional DDL.
   - `call_command` is used to run the `sqlmigrate` command and capture its output.

3. **Outcome logic**:
   - If `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;` are found in the output, it means the issue is reproduced.
   - If they are not found, the issue is resolved.
   - If there are any exceptions, it prints "Other issues".

This test can be used to both reproduce the issue and verify once it has been fixed.
